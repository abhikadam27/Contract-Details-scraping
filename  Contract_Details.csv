The new configuration will also allow for a changing places facility providing inclusive access for our facilities. It will also address energy saving measures reducing the buildings carbon footprint contribution towards the council carbon neutral objectives.

All of the tender documents can be found in the ITT; they include specifications, survey drawings (electrical, drainage, structural and architectural), and details around H&S certification requirements.

The Holiday Activities Programme aims to offer a variety of exciting and interesting activities including, sports, creative and performing arts, and environmental activities. The Holiday Activities and Food Programme is a DfE-funded project that aims to provide activities for pupils in receipt of Free School Meals for a period during the summer holiday, the winter holiday and during the Easter holiday.

The programme has received funding from the Department for Education (DfE) to offer enriching activities and nutritious meals to school aged children and young people, from reception to year 11 (inclusive), who are eligible for benefits-related free school meals (FSM). School holidays are recognised as a pressure point for some families because of increased costs (such as food and childcare) and reduced incomes. For some children that can lead to a holiday experience gap, with children from disadvantaged families:

• less likely to access organised out-of-school activities
• more likely to experience 'unhealthy holidays' in terms of nutrition and physical health
• more likely to experience social isolation

This project is to provide an update to the previous air quality assessment evidence base carried out for the previous Borough Plan (2019). The updates are required due to the undertaking of the Borough Plan review to ensure the evidence base uses the latest and projected figures and is in line with latest legislation to assess the effects of the proposed housing and employment allocations that are to be brought forwards as part of the Review.

These sites consist of either new sites that have come forwards under the call for sites or the existing sites carried forwards from the previous plan period.

This work is to ensure the historic environment is conserved and enhanced and ensure that there are positive policies in place for the conservation and enjoyment of the historic environment for both designated and non-designated heritage assets and their settings.

This assessment should be based on the existing methodology and approach used within the Council's latest Borough Plan Heritage Assessment (2016) and Historic Environment Assessment (2014).

The Drinking Water Inspectorate published guidance on the use of UV irradiation for the disinfection of public water supplies in 2010, and this guidance was reviewed and updated in 2016.

The guidance and validation standard is intended for use primarily by public and private water suppliers within the UK. The current guidance document provides information on the design, operation and monitoring of UV irradiation as a process for the disinfection of public water supplies intended for domestic or food production purposes. The guidance may also be appropriate to the disinfection of waters analogous to public water supplies, such as unregulated or private water supplies.

The objectives are:
1. Conduct a review of current US and European validation standards and verification techniques. Search the grey and published literature for up to date evidence on the use of UV irradiation for the disinfection of public and private water supplies, including an evaluation of good operational practice.
2. Develop a prospective UK validation standard that can be used when installing small or large UV disinfection systems (public and private water supplies).
3. Amend the current DWI guidance, to maintain up to date technical relevance and ensure that the guidance is consistent and fit for purpose.",https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/Attachment/7295bb54-9d1b-4e5e-a4cf-07f6ce3f5e25,Defra,"17 Nobel House

NICA were Advisory Board members to the All Parliamentary Group for Longevity, which launched the Health of the Nation: A Strategy for Healthier Longer Lives (February 2020).

Longevity economies are not just about existing markets further developing to meet the needs of current ""older people"". They are also not just about products and services for independent living, or for older people's health and social care. Instead, the opportunity is much bigger. It is about through-life health and wellbeing, and investment in products and services that are essential in early and mid-life, to enable residents to enjoy longer, productive, healthier lives.

The CAV site as a whole will require £500m investment from both the public and private sector. The University will work with its principal development partner to develop a detailed commercial model for the site which will include identification of appropriate income sources to ensure the site is self-sustaining.

To help define future direction, the University now needs to undertake market research to gain a better understanding of which private and public entities with an interest in longevity and ageing could be potential tenants, collaborators or investors in the CAV project.

We envisage the research taking place in two phases: Phase I: Desk Top Research and Phase II: Primary Research. Phase II will be optional.",https://procontract.due-north.com/Advert?advertId=06245932-0b9e-ec11-8112-005056b64545,Leigh Anderson,"Newcastle University

This service is staffed by people with lived experience, and by sharing their experience and providing social and practical support to people, peer supporters aim to promote recovery, enhance feelings of belonging and hope to those with mental health needs and their families/networks. This support complements other types of support provided through the inpatient rehab team - from for example, psychiatry, occupational therapy, nursing, pharmacy, and support staff.

The service will therefore have a presence both on the wards, but also in the community for those who have access for escorted and non-escorted leave.

The service will also work alongside the newly introduced substance use service - which will support people with co-occurring mental health and substance use needs. It is important that the services work together to develop a culture of acceptance, moving away from a punitive culture. Peers who have lived experience of recovery from substance use will therefore be instrumental in helping people to recover, and in supporting relapse prevention.

The group of patients have needed to be placed outside the catchment area of their own GP practice, so with agreement with local practices an alternative service is commissioned to provide their ongoing clinical oversight.

Approximately 800 people are cared for in this way over the year, and approximately 140-180 on the caseload at any one time, with placements generally no more than six weeks although some considerably shorter and others longer and sometimes leading to long term placement.

Patients can be cared for in any home in the city, but at the time of the expression of interest there are some people in 'spot purchased beds but also groups residing in:
• Ashley Manor Care Home
• Woodland Villa Care Home
• Wisteria Care Home Roborough (DE mild/moderate assessment beds)

And then in April the Short-Term Care Centre will be opened in Mount Gould.

The service is provided by the incumbent for Plymouth. A GP is provided from 9am - 6pm daily, Monday to Friday. The service sees all new temporary residents for intermediate care AND end of life care within 24hours of arrival at the home (Mondays-Fridays). The service undertakes any bloods, other tests, referrals and completes a discharge summary for the patient's own GP at the time of transfer back to their care.

A significant amount of work is done by telephone and covid has encouraged more flexible ways of working, the requirement to undertake a face to visit has been relaxed if contact made, and a decision made regarding a plan of care within the timescale.

Interested providers are invited to complete a short questionnaire as part of an information gathering exercise by NHS Devon CCG to inform their strategic direction and decision making. The questionnaire is available to download and complete within the Additional Text section of this PIN.

The deadline for completing the questionnaire is 12.00 noon on the 11th of April 2022.

It is envisaged that the contract term will commence on the 1st of October 2022 for 2 years with an option to extend for a further 2 years.

The anticipated contract value is £1.200,000 excl. VAT for the full term.

It is anticipated that the annual value will be £300,000 excl. VAT

Any values and timescales stated within this PIN notice are for guideline purposes only and should not be taken as a guarantee.

By working in partnership, as a healthcare consortium within and on behalf of collaborating trusts and or healthcare providers, we aim to seek out and collaborate with suppliers who are prepared to partner with us, and who share our values and ethos. This requires a collaborative procurement hub, aimed to provide optimum use of our combined capability and resources, reducing duplication and wasteful competition, where appropriate improved commercial outcomes, leading to potential reductions in cost for consortium members, wider NHS and public sector.

The approach and its perceived outcomes are to deliver best in class procurement solutions for the consortia and wider healthcare economy by executing a short-term procurement route via existing frameworks,

The Objectives of the consortia are to:
• Share benefit: developments are done for the benefit of all, not one.
• Share data: make data open so that existing products can still be used even when the new vendor has changed.
• Share financial rewards:
• when our NHS expertise is used to develop a product, rewards being shared back to the consortium.
• arrangement to be self-funding.
• Becoming Vendor neutral
• Collaborative working and sharing innovation and development

It has an annual expenditure of over £1bn on goods and services and a population of 1.6m. The Council provides a wide range of personal and strategic services on behalf of its residents, operating in partnership with the NHS Kent and Medway Clinical Commissioning Group, 12 district councils, and 289 parish/town councils. KCC consists of four directorates:

• Adult Social Care and Health;
• Children, Young People and Education;
• Growth, Environment and Transport; and
• Strategic and Corporate Services.

This service is being commissioned on behalf of the Growth, Environment and Transport directorate.

Scheme information
Due to their close geographic proximity, it is intended to procure the A20 Coldharbour Roundabout and Hall Road Junction schemes together as a single package.

The A20 Coldharbour Roundabout scheme requires the design and construction of a new larger roundabout to replace the existing signal-controlled roundabout junction on the A20 at Coldharbour Lane. The junction connects the A20 corridor to the Strategic Road Network at Junction 5 of the M20. The site is located 2km to the north-west of Maidstone, Kent on the A20 corridor between Allington and Aylesford.

The existing crossroad junction between the A20, Hall Road and Mills Road, approximately 500m to the west of the Coldharbour Roundabout, is to be improved by the design and construction of a lozenge shaped roundabout to replace the existing traffic signal-controlled junction. The Hall Road junction forms the only point of access to the busy Quarry Wood Industrial Estate and South Aylesford Retail Park.

The intent of both schemes is to support the level and distribution of development being proposed in the Tonbridge and Malling Borough Council and Maidstone Borough Council Local Plans, with new home allocations of around 843 dwellings per annum (dpa) and 883 dpa respectively. Furthermore, the schemes aim to ease congestion along the A20 corridor in Aylesford.

Suppliers should note and be aware that there is the possibility that the A20 Hall Road Junction Improvement may be withdrawn from the Contract, prior to the ITT being issued. In this situation the ITT will be issued for the A20 Coldharbour Roundabout only

The construction cost budget for the A20 Coldharbour Roundabout scheme is £3.5m and for the Hall Road Junction scheme it is £2.0m",https://procontract.due-north.com/Advert?advertId=10a26c0a-4daf-ec11-8113-005056b64545,Craig Merchant,"County Hall

This work is funded via the Eat4Change programme - a 4-year, EU funded project led by WWF-Finland and involving 12 other WWF offices across Europe.  The project aims to engage a youth+ audience (15-34) on the topic of sustainable food and diets, working together with young people directly for real life change on an individual and institutional level to achieve real impact for people and the planet, highlighting global interconnections and dependencies and demonstrating how individual lifestyle choices around food can directly contribute to limit warming to 1.5 degrees. Read more about the wider programme here: https://www.wwf.org.uk/eat4change

Objectives and scope
For this project we want to focus in on the top half of the Eat4Change target audience - 25 to 34 year olds in the UK. Our insights tell us that broadly speaking in the UK this age group want to reduce meat consumption and eat more healthily, agreeing that a plant-based diet will have a positive impact on the environment. They are also most likely to support in theory more restrictive measures to drive dietary change. However, this group are also amongst the biggest meat consumers.
Given the unique qualities of this age group, we want this project to:
(a) Identify the specific barriers preventing dietary change - exploring the reasons behind the attitude-behaviour gap - disaggregating by relevant demographic characteristics such as region and SES
(b) Assess openness to change, behaviour changes this audience would be willing to adopt (e.g., eating less meat, buying better meat such as organic) and what they would need to adopt and maintain these behaviours (e.g., changes to the food environment)
(c) Develop interventions and/or communications approaches to overcome identified barriers, and field-test them to understand effectiveness at supporting healthier, more sustainable choices in real-world environments such as supermarkets and restaurants
(d) Provide insight as to the role WWF can play in driving dietary shift with this audience, including identifying how this age group perceives WWF in relation to food and diets and recommending levers for change that could be implemented by the organisation
(e) Recommend routes, channels, moments and messengers through which WWF could reach this audience and drive change

At the briefing, we will share further detail of the commissioner's objectives for the services.

The provider will be required to deliver the end-to-end service, including the sourcing of products, management of the user interface(s) and the delivery of products directly to organisations.

The DfE's 2018 omnibus survey found that 83% of secondary school leaders reported making free period products available to pupils, with 41% doing so because of a reason related to pupils' inability to afford period products. Of the secondary school leaders who reported making free products available, 78% said provision was funded from school budgets, 26% used charitable donations and 17% said teachers funded products themselves.

No-one should be held back from reaching their potential, which is why we announced a scheme to provide access to free period products in schools and colleges in England, which is fully funded by the government. On 20 January 2020, the DfE launched the national period products scheme for all state maintained schools and 16-19 education organisations.

In January 2022, DfE announced that 68% of eligible organisations had accessed the scheme since it began, including 90% of eligible secondary schools. Period Products Scheme: 2021 Management Information (publishing.service.gov.uk)

The Department has published a tendering opportunity to find a single national supplier who can from September 2022:

DCC is committed to studying the causes of road traffic collisions with a view to putting in place whatever remedial measures may be necessary to reduce both the volume and severity of road traffic collisions. Some of these measures may be localised to a specific location following a single road traffic collision.

Detailed analysis is undertaken of all road traffic collision data on both a routine and ad hoc basis, and intelligence is prepared from that analysis to guide the deployment of road safety resources. These resources include but are not exclusive to engineering, education, training and communications funded by DCC.

Some incidents are so serious as to warrant immediate and specific investigation with associated recommendations for action. Typically, these incidents are those involving a loss of life or where life threatening or life changing injuries are identified early enough to facilitate a rapid investigative response.

Service provision will be in the form of 2 single lot contracts, operating across the city of Southampton enabling service users to be rapidly discharged from acute hospital setting, (University Hospital Southampton (UHS)) and other sources. Each contract will have an initial term of 6 months, with scope for extension by up to 2 periods each of 3 months at the Council's discretion. The provider will offer both planned and urgent home care visits. The Council's preference is that this Invitation to Tender will source two providers of each provider delivering one of the single lot contracts on offer. This is to maximise the sustainability of service provision and the delivery of the anticipated volumes of care hours needed each week. The Council does, however, reserve the right to award both contracts to a single provider in given circumstances outlined in the procurement documentation. The financial envelope for this procurement is up to £939,500 across the 2 lots as follows: Lot 1: Up to £469, 750 (for the period covered by the 6 months initial term + 3 months extension + 3 months extension) to deliver a minimum of 250 hours per week, citywide, up to a maximum requirement of 375 hours per week. Lot 2: Up to £469, 750 (for the period covered by the 6 months initial term + 3 months extension + 3 months extension) to deliver a minimum of 250 hours per week, citywide, up to a maximum requirement of 375 hours per week. In the event of additional funding becoming available the Council may exercise the option to modify either or both of the lot contracts to proportionately increase their value to enable the maximum delivery of weekly hours under each contract to increase to up to 450. The Service Provider(s) will work in partnership with UHS, Southampton City Council, Urgent Response Service, the Community Independence Service, Care Technology, and the UHS Single Point of Access Team. This will ensure the safe and rapid discharge of the service user back into the community for a limited time while onward permanent packages of care are sourced. Service users will be adults aged over 18 who meet the Care Act eligibility criteria for funded support, including people with physical/sensory disabilities; learning disabilities; mental health needs; acquired brain injury; substance misuse needs; dementia; people with neuro developmental disorders (e.g. autism / Asperger's/epilepsy). Please see the Procurement Documentation for more details relating to the service specification. Due to the urgency for the service provision, this procurement will follow an accelerated Open type procedure and will be conducted in compliance with The Public Contracts Regulations 74-77, 2015, under the Light Touch Regime. It is essential that the service provider is able to commence service delivery from the contract start date of 1st July 2022.",https://supplierlive.proactisp2p.com/Account/Login,-,"Civic Centre,Civic Centre Road

Lambeth Council currently has no single document archiving solution which enables consistent, timely and accurate identification and retrieval of all historical records in line with legislation, council requirements and citizen / community needs. Consequently, individual council departments have historically adopted their own local practices, systems and/or suppliers; although the bulk of the Council's physical records are managed by a third party. This approach fails to benefit from the efficiencies of a centralised solution, and has resulted in a number of operational issues, such as:

 Inability to locate files needed e.g. for public enquiries
 Inability to retrieve files in a timely manner
 Inability to reconcile inventoried files vs physical files
 Files being stored in incorrect boxes, destroying the integrity of the inventory
 Files being stored outside of recognised protocols
 Files not being indexed or catalogued
 Lack of consistent metadata / indices against which searches can be conducted
 Difficulty assuring compliance owing to different practices across the council

Taken together, these present an opportunity to develop the council's service delivery in line with legislation and the needs of its citizens and communities.

Solution

To address the issues above, the Council has instituted a Digital Records Programme (DRP). The DRP is targeted with identifying and procuring a single, council-wide, digital solution which enables the council to store, access and retrieve its records quickly, safely and securely. This solution will include digitisation of historic physical files, digital and physical storage, along with an IT solution and operational changes which transform the whole Council's approach to historic record management. While primarily a compliance-led programme arising from the desire to address operational inefficiencies, the council will also need to procure a physical warehousing solution by the time existing arrangements with the current third party provider expire in summer 2023. The council may also wish to leverage opportunities for additional operational benefits where cost-effective to do so.

Current status

The DRP has been gathering requirements, mapping business processes and performing due diligence on existing records to understand the scale of the issue and shape the solution. The intent in due course will be to issue one or more invitations to tender for suppliers to provide digital and physical services and solutions to the council. Prior to this though, the council wish to understand from experts in the market some rough order of magnitude costs and time associated with these undertakings. These estimates will inform the Council's business planning, potential solutions, and any future tender(s). This is the purpose of this request for information.

Please refer to the attached documentation for further information.

• Integration of adult social care & health
• The government's levelling up ambitions
• Adult social care reforms
• Closing the funding gap.

Over the course of the last few years SCC has demonstrated its ability to successfully address big service and corporate issues, but predominantly this has been within defined service areas. However, to meet the ambitions set out above, SCC will need to transition into an organisation that works well across internal and external boundaries, working collaboratively to tackle complex issues.

The Scope of work/schedule in Section 4 sets out what is considered to be the core components of the Development Frameworks, although the Council is open to suggestions on alternative clustering of content and approaches. The geography for the lots is based upon constituency boundaries rather than Local Plan spatial planning boundaries, although there is a degree of cross-over between the two. The city commission (Lot 1) excludes the geographical area of Shipley and Baildon (both part of the regional city for panning purposes), although it is expected that there will be a strong crossover and connection between the development framework areas. Lot 1 combines a development framework for the city (with Bradford parliamentary constituencies) together with an important new masterplan for Bradford Southern Gateway and an urban design framework with related services for Holme Wood. Lots 2 and 3 are concerned with developing town-centric development frameworks for two very varied parts of the District. The Keighley constituency includes the towns of Keighley and Ilkley with significantly different characters and opportunities, while Lot 3 includes Bingley and Shipley with similarly strong local features and growth propositions. Depending upon the outcome of the tendering exercise there will be a need to work with other consultancy teams very closely on connections and critical content issues across development frameworks.",https://uk.eu-supply.com/app/rfq/rwlentrance_s.asp?PID=44679&B=UK,Richard Ullyott,"Britannia House, Hall Ings

The contracts have been designed to deliver a range of enhanced primary care services via 347 GP practices and/or GP federations in each of the 8 boroughs in North West London. Full patient population coverage is central to improving local care, and reducing variability in people's outcomes, so that every patient has access to the range of services offered.

Specifications within the contracts are for out of hospital services include services such as phlebotomy, ECG, diabetes and are outcomes based.

The contracts have been designed to focus on improving clinical outcomes, driving improvements in the consistency of care provision in all GP practices, reduce unwarranted variation in general practice, and reduce health and care inequalities.

The contracts are delivered in general practices and at scale by PCNs/other GP led organisations to enable providers to deliver the full range of services covered by the contracts and full patient population coverage.

The CCG currently has contract arrangements in place with all 347 GP practices and with some GP Federations where services are delivered at scale through NHS Standard Contracts. The contract term expires on 31st March 2022. The primary focus for 2022/23 is to transition to PCN based contracts and delivery from 2023/24. By moving to PCN level delivery, it is envisaged it will lead to a better integrated, resilient primary care working which will embed effective population health management thereby improving health outcomes for the whole population it serves.

The CCG is of the view that the 347 GP Practices and GP federations in the 8 boroughs of North West London are the only providers capable of delivering these services because this provider group has access to the registered list of patients, can proactively identify patients and has access to the entire patient medical record. This will enable continuity of care and provide services at a location closer to patients home.

The ICN Bed Principles are as follows:
• To support people with escalating health issues that may end in hospitalisation if not provided with additional support offered by an ICN Hostel Bed - some improvements in health should be expected to take place within a 1-6 week timeframe.
• Some recent history of multiple A&E attendances (5 or more within last 12 months).
• Recourse to public funds.
• To support the health needs of the person through an MDT approach that will enable the integrated care network to coalesce around the individual in order to ensure that appropriate care planning processes can be established e.g. the development & management of an individual care plan etc.
• The ICN Bed should only be used as 'step-up' & not 'step down' provision i.e. the key remit for use of the bed is to prevent hospital admission & not to take those discharged straight from hospital.
• Access to routine hostel accommodation through the usual channels has been tried for the individual concerned but without success.

The local provider (The Passage) has been providing the service.

As a condition of receiving this grant funding, in the 2 following years (2023/24-2024/25), local authorities will need to submit to the Department of Health and Social Care (""DHSC"") a cost of care exercise, a provisional market sustainability plan and a spend report detailing how the 2022/23 funding has been allocated in line with government expectations, in order to achieve a more sustainable local market, by September 2022.

On this basis, it is proposed that Doncaster Council seeks to engage an external independent resource to undertake the Fair Cost of Care exercise for 65+ residential and nursing care homes and 18+ homecare to determine a sustainable fee rate for different care settings from 23/24 and provisional market sustainability plan, within the Council's defined framework.
Doncaster Council expect the independent resource to use the regionally produced homecare toolkit provided by LGA & ADASS in partnership with ARCC and the care home toolkit that is expected to be provided to local authorities by early April 2022.
It is anticipated that the independent resource will be required to engage with providers, support them to undertake the exercise, and make the submission to the Council. The independent resource will also be expected to analyse the response, provide a draft report and overall submission to the Doncaster DASS for scrutiny and review ahead of any regional or national submission. Clear timelines and expectations will be provided for completion and the independent resource will act as a facilitator and analyst to ensure completion by the required timeline.
It is anticipated that the independent resource will be able to submit the Fair Cost of Care for Homecare in May 2022 for regional moderation and the Fair Cost of Care for Care Homes at the end of June 2022 although these timescales are currently in discussion across the Yorkshire and Humber region.
Any interested parties should provide a written submission outlining:
• Their experience and skills in delivering a Fair Cost of Care exercise

It can be accessed only by a passenger ferry or by driving over the sands at low tide (permission of foreshore owner and local guidance required).

The island is owned by the Council, and is occupied by a number of privately owned cottages, a castle (managed by English Heritage) and a public house, The Ship Inn, with an adjacent toilet and shower block. The toilet and shower block is used mainly by casual visitors to the island, and people camping on the island. The Ship Inn has its own toilets and the licensees manage camping on the island.

The toilet/shower is a blockwork building with a corrugated roof, approximately 40sqm. The gents has 2 cubicles, 2 urinals, 1 shower and 3 w/h/b. The ladies has 3 cubicles, 1 shower and 4 w/h/b. There is also an external sink. There is a mains water supply, and drainage is to a septic tank. Photographs of the facility are shown below.

As part of the Low Carbon Barrow programme, the Council wishes to upgrade the facilities on Piel Island and replace the existing toilet and shower block with facilities that are an improvement for users and which also have a low environmental impact.

We are therefore seeking suitable contractors to design and build a new toilet/shower block. This should support the low/zero carbon ethos, e.g. solar power, sustainable materials, sustainable drainage, whilst providing enhanced facilities for users.

The opportunity will be let under a JCT Design and Build contract, and the successful contractor will therefore be responsible for the detailed design elements of the new facility.

A key element of this has been the GM Local Full Fibre Network (LFFN) ""anchor tenancy"" programme that is in the final stages of laying up to 2,700km of new fibre infrastructure across Greater Manchester leveraging DCMS funding plus investment from GMCA(FRS), TFGM and seven of the councils. This work will be complete by early 2022/23 and will connect approx. 1,600 public sites drive fibre into new areas of Greater Manchester.
'Lighting' the fibre is the next step, each of the public sector organisations that are part of the LFFN anchor tenancy programmes operate their own networks. Recognising that LFFN is providing a shared fibre infrastructure, in 2020 several of the partners considered the option for jointly procuring network services across the fibre infrastructure for their own organisational needs and to take advantage of the economies of scale.
A set of options were considered and it was agreed to collaboratively light the fibre with other LFFN partners giving high speed gigabit access to the GM region and all public sector bodies, by implementing a next generation, software-defined, integrated gigabit network.
Early in 2021 Bury, Oldham and Rochdale and Stockport Councils plus TFGM and GMCA(FRS) went to market to select a partner to design, build and operate the GM One Network via a competitive dialogue process. A preferred supplier was selected in December and GMCA are working with the preferred supplier with a view to signing contracts and commencing the project early in April.
The core network will be a segment routed network transport that that will be delivered on top of the LFFN network covering 33 BT exchanges and 2 Co Location sites around the Greater Manchester region.

The innovation uses local knowledge to assist the local economy. The vision is to create and support a sustainable tourist economy, through delivering key, real-time information promoting safe experiences in a given area.

Since 2010 tourism has been the fastest growing sector in the UK in employment terms. Britain is forecast to have a tourism industry worth over £257 billion by 2025. In 2018, Cornwall's economy was worth £9 billion a year, of which £1.8bn came from tourism. This equated to 4 million visitors that year alone. During the same year, 26 people died accidentally off the county's coastline. This statistic is based on 2018 figures, prior to Covid-19 and the dramatic increase in UK tourism due to travelling restrictions. May 2020 saw 6 coastal deaths in only 8 days. In August 2020, Cornwall was ""largely full to current capacity"", according to local police. On one weekend, Devon and Cornwall Police saw a 26% increase in 999 callouts compared with 2019. No platform currently integrates real-time data to inform and educate people on the dangers of our coastline.

To date the project has been through a discovery phase involving a workshop with key stakeholders to explore the requirements for the mobile applications. From this a wireframe clickable prototype was developed in Figma, which shows the interactions and general experience that we are looking for. The wireframe will therefore form a key input into the development of the application, but tenderers should not be limited by this initial design.

We are seeking a software developer to build a publicly available development app for testing over the summer on three Cornish beaches and the surrounding amenities.",https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/Attachment/cdc8bddf-e195-4c1c-b814-bcdc060d67ed,-,"Fentonladock Cottage,Ladock

London and Quadrant Housing Trust are tendering for the provision of Services for Fire Engineering and Inspections for London and Quadrant's Self Delivered New Build Projects to comply with the Public Contracts regulations 2015. The objective of this tender process is to establish a Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS) with the tenderers and London and Quadrant Housing Trust. The dates and contract value are estimates and could be subject to change. This tender is for Service Providers and Consultants only.

This tender process is being carried out in accordance with the provisions of Regulation 34 of the Public Contracts Regulations (PCR) 2015 relating to the procurement of a Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS) for the purchase of Goods and Services.

The DPS is open to Admitted Suppliers throughout the period of validity.
'Admitted Supplier' means a supplier who has met the DPS admission criteria set out in the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (SSQ) and has been registered on the DPS for one or more product categories. Suppliers and products may be submitted for evaluation and potentially, admission to the DPS at any time throughout the period of validity.

Suppliers who have been unsuccessful in meeting the criteria to become an 'Admitted Supplier' may re-submit another, revised SSQ at any time beyond the initial mini competition.
Potential reasons for being removed from DPS list:
- KPI's (performance on projects). Providers who receive poor KPI scores could be removed from the DPS
- Uncompetitive tenders on a regular basis
- Poor response or no responses to tender enquires
- Financial data changes (assessed at least yearly) - assessed against original SSQ submission. Could either lead to complete removal or dropping out of some lots but not others. Could also lead to others growing to a state where qualify for higher lots.
- If credit limit falls below 41, you will be suspended
- If credit score falls to 30 (high risk) or less you will be removed from the DPS",https://in-tendhost.co.uk/quadrant-construction/aspx/,Zahid Ahmed,"West Ham Lane

The Universal Healthcare Network is unique in the range of expertise it brings together which resulted in three clear provocations on Universal Healthcare which are not being addressed by the mainstream inequalities agenda, or the NHSE Core20Plus Collaborative or High Impact Improvement Network. The proposed Innovation and Change Labs and Inquiry work are being presented at the High Impact Improvement Network and the Core20Plus Collaborative as it is deemed to complement the national programme but is distinctly different (and unique) from any other initiative being undertaken or proposed at this time.
Specialist expertise is required from London South Bank University as a member of National Universal Healthcare Network and which owns the Intellectual Property (Universal Healthcare Innovation and Change Labs) to seek to address this issue. In discussion with the National Universal Healthcare Network, LSBU developed a comprehensive proposal on how participating ICS', (West Yorkshire, Bradford) and (Sussex, Hastings) could be supported to implement a methodology and approach to designing services in a different way which would secure universal healthcare and reduce inequalities.
LSBU would provide support on implementing an approach and methodology, (Universal Healthcare Innovation and Change Labs), which is the Intellectual Property of the University.
The rationale of the Commissioning Authority for this action is therefore because:
• Specialist expertise is required from LSBU as a member of National Universal Healthcare Network to seek to address this issue.
• This proposal would be a lever to achieving progress against adoption of a population health approach aimed at improving the health and wellbeing of local populations and reducing health inequalities at pace.
• The work is deemed to complement the national Healthcare Inequalities Improvement Programme but is distinctly different (and unique) from any other initiative being undertaken or proposed at this time.
• To seek alternative suppliers would be a duplication of effort.

If you wish to express an interest or should you wish to discuss the content of this PIN further, please do this by sending a portal message via the Intend e-Tendering portal in the first instance.
The deadline for expressions of interest is 12:00pm (midday) on Thursday 28th April.
If no expressions of interest are received, the Authority shall enter into a contract with the provider, relying upon a Regulation 32 exemption of no response/no requests to participate have been submitted in response to this notice.

This Framework is designed to meet the needs of both YPO and Other Contracting Authorities by establishing an agreement where the end customer will enter into an electricity supply agreement with the Supplier and the Supplier will supply electricity, as well as any ancillary services that the customer requires, direct to the end customer.
Any potential tenderers must have a commercial supply licence and listed on the OFGEM approved supplier list.

The Framework Agreement will cover the period from 1st April 2023 to 31st March 2027 with two options to extend for an additional 24 months. The first decision to extend the contract period will be taken by January 2025 and will be dependent on satisfactory completion of all aspects of the contract to date, the current market conditions for this category and YPO's contracting structures. The maximum contract period will therefore be 8 years, from 1st April 2023 to 31st March 2031 (subject to an annual review, incorporating management fee negotiations and KPI performance).

The justification for a 4+2+2 (possible 8 years in total) length Framework, is due to the complexity of the proposed Framework Agreement, taking account of the national procurement policy around tackling climate change and given the nature of the service/product, to ensure customers can gain the maximum benefits from using the Framework without compromising the potential for open competition in the wider market. Wholesale electricity prices are currently at the highest ever and having a longer Framework, will allow for YPO to operate a much longer term purchasing strategy without the complexities of sleeving to another provider. A longer term purchasing strategy will mitigate risk for our customers and YPO will be able to provide them with longer term budget certainty in a volatile market. We have also considered that the majority of our customer have declared climate emergencies and have net zero targets of 2030 and beyond and the UK Government itself has a legally-binding target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. Having a longer term partnership with an electricity Supplier in a framework format will support our customers on this journey, as one of the biggest contributors to carbon emissions is energy consumption. The collaborative approach with a Supplier for a longer period, will allow for support with reducing consumption/becoming more efficient, setting up effective power purchase agreements and potential for additional support on social value.",http://procontract.due-north.com/,Contracts Team,"41 Industrial Park

The Commission



Overview of work for NHMF annual report

1. Provide three design concepts for initial design of NHMF annual report - with consideration given to allow for typeset Welsh text and how the design can be adapted and evolved in years 2 and 3. Visit the NHMF website for links to recent NHMF annual reports (with the exception of 2019/2020, which did not include preceding case studies).

2. Develop chosen design concept and typeset with copy

3. Use English copy supplied in Word documents, design and typeset the annual report.

4. Incorporate several rounds of author's amends often with a fast turnaround.
For information, edits to the content of the reports in later rounds is out of our control and all amends are required to be made. There could be as many as 7 or 8 sets of author's amends - the later rounds of amendments are significantly lighter than earlier ones. Flexibility to turnaround text edits (including numbers within tables) within a short period of time is key to this project. We can provide a publication schedule with rough dates of when amends will come but these dates are flexible.

5. Images will be supplied for the front end of the report but additional retouching/cut-outs may be necessary

6. Proof read for design-related issues, including page references.

7. Provide a print-ready PDF and liaise with printers, including checking printer's proofs.

8. Provide a web-ready PDF - fully accessible to WCAG 2.1 standards. This is also a key stage to the process. Please note that if you are unable to provide this service in-house, you will need to outsource to an accessibility provider.

9. Use Welsh text, provided in Word document, to typeset Welsh version - overlaying onto English copy, using same layout and table options. Flag page references and any other design-related copy for NHMF in-house translators to check.

10. Provide a print-ready PDF of Welsh copy and liaise with printers, including checking printer's proofs.

11. Provide a web-ready PDF of Welsh copy - fully accessible to WCAG 2.1 standards.

12. Evolve and develop the year 1 design into years 2 and 3 and repeat items 3-11 in years 2 and 3.

The British Council and Ecctis - UK ENIC developed a quality assurance framework endorsed by the Ministry of Education which underpinned the EMI enhancement plan template which universities used for funding application. Ecctis and a few UK academics were involved in the review of the plans with local reviewers. This project will involve three distinct phases: a review of institutional policy documents, surveys and focus groups of relevant stakeholders from these institutions as well as site inspections involving lesson observations.
As part of Taiwan's 2030 bilingual policy, the BEST project aimed to cultivate the English proficiency of students and improve the quality of teaching through the medium of English with the aspiration to promote and develop bilingualism.

BEST involves a wide range of institutions; the four 'Key Cultivation Universities' are: National Cheng Kung University, National Sun Yat-sen University, National Taiwan University and National Taiwan Normal University. These universities have EMI policies that cut across several disciplines. In addition, there are 41 'Key Cultivation Colleges' who are grouped according to the four disciplines the Taiwanese government has prioritised for the improvement of their international competitiveness and general improvement of Taiwan's graduates. These 41 colleges sit under 25 universities.

The purpose of this project is to review the progress of the BEST programme focusing on the efficacy of institutional policy, capacity and delivery of EMI. In addition, it is to provide insight on the opportunities and challenges faced by different institutions as they develop their EMI capabilities as well as to provide recommendations on how best practice across different disciplines can be shared and what options exist for progressing BEST further.

As institutions are at different stages of EMI implementation and resourcing varies, this study is needed to provide both the Taiwanese government and the British Council with a macro-view of progress made to date as well as identifying trends and shared challenges as well as strengths in order to inform further policy development in this area.",https://in-tendhost.co.uk/britishcouncil/aspx/,Brian D'Mello,"Stratford

As part of our wider work to bolster cross-sector recovery and long-term resilience, this forthcoming innovation programme will seek to help UK heritage to explore, develop and test new approaches that have the potential to respond to long-range heritage workforce challenges. Discovery research which engaged with sector representatives evidenced workforce challenges as a consistent, persistent, and widespread theme across all heritage sectors with clear opportunities to experiment with new models of working and thinking.

As the first step, we want to provide experimenting practitioners from any sphere of UK heritage with a structured programme of support providing access to the time, skills, learning and peer support needed to stimulate and incubate new ideas for future heritage working practices.
This initial commission spans two phases:
• Pre-application workshops (May and October 2022)
• Cohort content design and facilitation across the two cohorts (August 2022 - June 2023)
NB: We anticipate two cohorts consisting of approximately 17 organisations (34 in total), will be awarded pilot funding by the Heritage Fund. Each cohort will work intensively with the innovation support partner over the initial 6 month period of their grant so that they are prepared and ready to prototype and test their ideas if further funding is secured.

We have identified several projects that will run under this programme, one of which is the review of our physical infrastructure and where this could or should be located.

We currently have 2 datacentres (or machine rooms) one of which is located at our Newcastle city campus (Northumberland building) and the other at our Coach Lane campus.

As part of the Programme, we have a vision to migrate some (or eventually all) of our current physical infrastructure to a CoLo datacentre and cloud based suite of services removing the use of both our datacentres. Whilst the primary drivers for this are increased reliability, security and less overhead, this change should also increase our operating efficiency and drive overall better value for money.

As we are a Newcastle based university, we require a CoLo datacentre within 25 miles of Newcastle city centre to ensure staff can visit as and when necessary.
To ensure that we remain compliant with our various obligations, security needs to be considered which may be physical in the form of a cage, but in any event needs to be logical. Any interested supplier is encouraged to consider this in their eventual proposal.

We are interested in receiving proposals from interested suppliers that can meet the above scope covering the following at a minimum in detail:
-Based no further than 25 miles from Newcastle city centre
-Initial requirement is for 13 racks each with a 32amp/7kW redundant power supply
-Contract commit based on 60% of the total power consumption initially
-Connectivity to Azure and AWS
-Connectivity to our Janet network and Newcastle city campus
-Optional cage
-Other required and recommended one-off items (e.g. installation, powerbars, etc.)
-Recommended logical security
-Details of building security measures and controls

The programme, using over 200 tonnes of biochar, will address uncertainties regarding the extent and scope of deployment and its stability with respect to carbon sequestration, together with quantifying effects on ecosystem services. The framework will allow UoN to secure compliant supply chains and call off materials.

Tender Technical Specification: Starting in summer of 2022, UoN will be deploying 100-150 tonnes of biochar to arable lands across farms in the UK, for which we require biochar of EBC (European Biochar Certificate) Agro II specification. The biochar required must be suitable for application using agricultural spreaders with minimal dust production, which in practice means particle sizes of 1-5 mm. Over the following 3 years we may also require tonne quantities (1-10 tonnes) of biochar for smaller trials on an ad hoc basic, with the potential for larger quantities dependant on research demands. The biochar required must be produced from sustainable feedstocks, either virgin wood or sustainable organic by-products, and must have a minimal ash content and high carbon content. A low H/C content is required to ensure stability of carbon sequestration. Fossil carbon in the char must be negligible.

Implementation timetable:
o Full specification of biochar submitted at tender stage, meeting EBC specification.
o Production of initial quantities of up to 50 tonnes of Biochar, either delivered to sites across the UK, or available for collection from production sites within the UK or EU by a third-party delivery company in August 2022.
o Up to 20 tonnes of biochar to be produced on request, at 4 weeks' notice.
o Continued support and dialogue around any deviation from biochar to specification.",https://in-tendhost.co.uk/universityofnottingham/aspx/,Sabrina Cox,"Lenton Lane

Leicester City Council is considering the commissioning of a Participation Service which will help us to ensure that people drawing on the support of our Social Care & Health services are equal partners and that their lived experiences are a primary consideration when we are planning and designing the support and services that are needed.

We would like the future service to continue to recruit, train and support people drawing on support that live in Leicester to share their lived experiences and influence Social Care and Health service design and delivery.

As part of the commissioning process, we are undertaking a Soft Market Test. This gives potential providers of care and support services and other people or groups that may have an interest in this area of work, the opportunity to express their interest and feed in their views about this area. Commissioners will use the information to explore alternative options and further develop a model of delivery.

This process does not constitute a formal tender or other competitive bidding process and it will not result in the letting of a Contract. We are using this process solely to test the market to gather information and ascertain the level of interest in this particular service area. There are therefore no formal criteria being used to judge your responses and we do not intend to provide any feedback.

If the decision is made to tender for this service, it is anticipated this will be published in September 2022, with the new contract ready to start with effect from 01/07/2023.

To participate in this Soft Market Testing, organisations that may be interested should complete a Soft Market Testing questionnaire. The questionnaire can be found by copying and pasting the following web link into your web browser: https://procontract.due-north.com/Advert?advertId=50af4fd2-38ac-ec11-8112-005056b64545

In order to help achieve our goal of tackling climate change through land-use planning and wider strategy development the Council is seeking to appoint a suitably qualified consultant team to help develop its evidence base and provide guidance on a range of matters to inform policy development.

From a plan making perspective, the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) and Planning Practice Guidance (PPG) provide a clear steer in terms of the evidence and policy requirements needed to tackle climate change. Ultimately, the Study will need to be capable of helping ensure the Local Plan is legally compliant .

The Council is currently preparing a number of strategies aimed at delivering synergistic step-changes towards tackling climate change. The review of the Wiltshire Core Strategy provides a real opportunity to introduce land-use policies to guide forecast growth in a manner that delivers sustainable development designed to tackle and adapt to and mitigate the effects of our changing climate.

Further evidence is required to support plans and policies which will support Wiltshire's move towards Carbon zero - specifically in relation to renewable energy resources. Please note this is a revised requirement. Previous publication DN595620.

ACDECA/017 - In-Service Support for Ultrasonic NDT Equipment, Evident GMBH - Voluntary Transparency Notice (VTN)

The Defence Electronics & Components Agency (DECA), part of the UK Ministry of Defence, intends to award a contract to Evident GMBH (formally Keymed Ltd), for the support and repair of Ultrasonic NDT Equipment. The contract shall be for a period of 3 years with an anticipated value of £190K excluding VAT. Evident GMBH are the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the Ultrasonic Flaw Detector (UFD) EPOCH 600, it supplies and procures the spare parts for the equipment. Evident GMBH have the expert technical knowledge required for the test, calibration and repair of the equipment.

It is considered that this contract can be placed with Evident GMBH using the negotiated procedure without prior publication of a contract notice, pursuant to Regulation 32(2)(b)(ii) of the UK Public Contracts Regulations 2015. This is based on technical reasons, as Evident GMBH are the only economic operator with the specific technical know-how, tools, documentation and means to meet this requirement.

The Evident GMBH equipment is required for MoD units to carry out inspections on, and assist with repairs, to aircraft equipment. If they are not supported, the capability to inspect aircraft equipment will be greatly reduced and potentially lost. This may lead to safety risks to the aircraft and cause Aircraft on Ground.

Evident GMBH are the OEM and subject matter experts for the EPOCH 600 UFD equipment, Design Authority and manufacturer of the equipment. Evident GMBH do not supply spares to third party companies and therefore no other supplier is able to fulfil this requirement.

Keymed Ltd are dividing their company, with Evident GMBH taking over the Ultrasonic Flaw Detector (UFD) EPOCH 600 equipment.",https://www.contracts.mod.uk/go/64605144017FB86174DD,-,"DECA Sealand

The service includes a wet room facility which provides an alternative to street drinking and assists people to learn how to manage their drinking and to engage in recovery support.

This gives potential providers and other stakeholders the opportunity to express their interests and feed in their views about the potential service model and specification principles. The Commissioners will use the information to appraise options and further develop the specification.

This is required for the proposed noise barrier structure to be installed as part of the works it is undertaking on behalf of HS2 for the S1 and S2 sectors of the main civil engineering tranche of HS2 Phase One. The proposed noise barrier structure is c.1.5km in length and is to be installed either side of the HS2 trace along the West Ruislip Retained Embankment (including the Breakspear Road South and River Pinn Underbridges) and the Gatemead Embankment.

It is SCS JV's preference to engage a specialist precast concrete installer to install the precast reinforced-concrete noise barriers into position, including the design, installation and removal of the required temporary works (e.g. Kelly blocks, props, pedestals, pancake jacks, etc.), whereby it is understood that the FRC works relating to the construction of the torsion beams may either be delivered directly by the specialist precast concrete installer or subsubcontracted to an FRC subsubcontractor.

PLEASE REFRAIN FROM RESPONDING TO THIS OPPORTUNITY UNLESS YOU HAVE READ IT IN FULL AND HAVE THE CAPABILITIES / EXPERTISE TO UNDERTAKE WHAT IS REQUIRED, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE COMPLEXITY.
Following responses to this opportunity, the supply chain will be shortlisted accordingly. Those that are successful will be invited to prequalify in order to receive a tender enquiry for this package. Prequalification will consist of 'business assurance', which will focus on the supply chain's capability, competence and capacity to work with SCS JV, and (potentially) technical assurance, which provides an opportunity to assess the supply chain's ability to carry out the subcontract works for the package in question. It is likely that this has been classified as a 'medium-risk' package (to be confirmed), whereby the 'business assurance' element of prequalification may be satisfied if the supply chain partner holds one of the Common Assessment Standard (CAS) accreditations, namely:

- Achilles Building Confidence (with Desktop Audit) - Achilles Building Confidence (with Site Audit) may be required if the package is classified as high risk,
- Constructionline Gold - Constructionline Platinum may be required if the package is classified as high risk, or
- CHAS Elite.

Further to a tender process, final selection will be based upon a balanced-scorecard evaluation. The criteria of this evaluation will consider commercial, technical and qualitative (e.g. health & safety, quality, environment & sustainability, etc.) evidence provided by the tenderers as part of their respective tender bids.
SCS JV is an unincorporated joint venture between Skanska Construction UK Limited (""Skanska""), Costain Limited (""Costain"") and STRABAG AG (""STRABAG"") working on behalf of HS2 to deliver the main civil engineering works for the S1 and S2 sectors of HS2 Phase One. The Early Contractor Involvement (ECI) stage of the contract, where SCS JV was developing a scheme design, programme and target cost to deliver the detailed design and construction phase of the project, is now complete, whereby a Notice to Proceed to Stage Two (detailed design and construction) was issued on 15th April 2020. Not only have the individual companies delivered high-speed rail, major infrastructure and some of the most iconic structures internationally, SCS JV also has a proven record of working together. Skanska and Costain have a long history of successfully delivering civil engineering projects together in the UK, dating back 30 years. In joint venture they have delivered many major infrastructure projects, including the M25 in the 1980s, High Speed 1 in the early 2000s and the current Crossrail endeavour, shortly coming to completion under the streets of London. STRABAG and Skanska have worked together for over 15 years on European projects in Switzerland, Slovakia and Norway. As a joint venture, we are bringing together our collective strength to deliver world-class engineering, contributing to the long-term economic growth of local and international markets. This is perfectly encapsulated in our mission; to draw everyone together to create a strong foundation from which to launch a transformative legacy.

The primary focus is to better understand the market, supplier appetite, capacity and capability to continue supplying fuel to the Woolwich Ferry by bunker barge.

This is not a call for competition but is an early market engagement exercise to enable TfL to better understand the market appetite, capacity and capability to supply fuel to the Woolwich Ferry by bunker barge.

Due to operational and infrastructure constraints, ferry fuel must be supplied to the two vessels by barge. The vessels were built to receive fuel easily by barge and the engines are built specifically to receive Ultra Low Sulphur Diesel (10ppm).

The combined fuel consumption between the two vessels is within the range of 4,000 litres and 12,000 litres per week. This fluctuation is determined by service frequency and whether both vessels are in operation.

Fuel delivery occurs outside of ferry service hours and requires delivery crews to connect the hoses to the ferry for fuel transfer.
TfL envisages this contract will be with a single supplier and be in place from August 2022 for a duration between 6 months and 15 months. The supplier will need to be licensed with the Port of London Authority (PLA) to supply fuel on the River Thames, London.

In parallel, TfL is exploring alternative fuelling arrangements for the future, such as to allow road-tanker delivery, however that will be the subject of its own PIN/procurement exercise. This notice is specifically for the purpose of establishing market interest for the provision of bunker barge fuel supply.

Therefore, TfL would like to invite potential bidders to engage with us; to find out more about the opportunity and discuss the nature of this forthcoming procurement exercise.

The prevalence and disease burden resulting from excess weight is a major international public health concern. Almost two-thirds of adults in England are living with excess weight for their height (BMI >=25kg/m2), with similar figures in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Moreover, approximately one in six people in the UK have hearing loss (NHS England).

The Council requires a supplier for the provision of a Tier 2 Weight Management service specifically designed to meet the needs of those residents who have hearing impairments.

This contract will be for a period of 12 months commencing 1st May 2022 until 31st March 2023.

Aim is to provide appropriate Tier 2 weight management services to those residents who have hearing impairments.

Providers must be able to provide users with advice and support on diet & appropriate physical activity relative to their needs which is age appropriate and considers their gender and ethnicity needs where relevant.

o For those with hearing impairments to be able to access the service. For example, people with hearing loss find it difficult or impossible to use the telephone so alternative ways of communication need to be emphasises, such as text relay, text phone or online services.
o The service should ensure it does not marginalise those with extremes of levels of hearing impairment, as this could further widen health inequalities. This takes into consideration recommendation 2 of PH53 which is to ensure services cause no harm. Reasonable adjustments should be made for different severities of hearing impairment, to ensure equitable access to services. If deemed appropriate, the provider should offer different sessions tailored to different levels of hearing loss.
o The provider to directly establish with the user their weight loss goals and store these through the providers own confidentiality and data storing processes - this is a direct agreement between the provider and user. Examples of goals include to become more active, lose weight, feel healthier. Goals should be realistic to follow recommendation 7 of PH53 which is to address participants expectations.
o Explain the increased risks that being obese poses to them. Discuss the benefits and give advice on a healthy diet and regular physical activity which should be tailored to individual circumstances. Importantly, weight loss should not be their only goal and excess weight loss can result in other adverse health conditions. Therefore, the service should provide clarity to users where BMI falls below normal range. Again, this considers recommendation 2 of PH53, ensuring services cause no harm.
o They will provide a personalised assessment and advice about diet and physical activity. All services must be provided by a nutritionist/behaviour change therapist/physical activity specialist wh...",https://in-tendhost.co.uk/birminghamcc/aspx/,Manjit Samrai,"10 Woodcock Street

The path will create an aesthetically pleasing access route with carefully spaced bench seating with views over the adjacent Scrape. A ramp will be constructed to provide access from the North Wall, ensuring that the North Wall's function as a flood defence is unimpaired. A low-level path or boardwalk will then follow the line of the sea defence to the East Hide. This will involve creating a new bridge over the Scotts Hall Drain and meeting the apron of the hide so that wheelchair access is maintained.

The ramp from the North Wall will be created with granite-filled gabions and a surfaced path. The path from the base of the ramp has been specified similarly, but we would be keen to consider a boardwalk solution, preferably using recycled plastic boards for the decking and structure.

DO NOT apply directly to the buyer. All tender information MUST be submitted through the Delta eSourcing Portal.

Brief
The Office of Manpower Economics provides an independent secretariat to eight Pay Review Bodies. X-Factor is a pensionable addition to basic military pay intended to reflect the net disadvantage in conditions of service experienced by members of the Armed Forces compared with civilians. The level of X-Factor is typically reviewed every five years and this is the focus of this research project.

Overall aims of this research
• To inform the AFPRB's review of the level of X-Factor in 2022, ahead of its forthcoming report, to be published in 2023.
• To provide an assessment of the X-Factor components as they relate to the civilian sector.

Objectives of the procurement
• Identify and provide time-series data and analysis for the civilian sector relating to each of the X-Factor components as set out in the 2021 review (not yet published).
• Identify credible alternative data sources as a contingency in case those used previously are no longer available/out of date.
• Regarding the tapering of X-Factor for senior ranks, the project should ascertain whether the components vary by seniority within civilian life. Of particular interest are senior managers at an equivalent level to armed forces senior ranks.
• Data to cover the period from 2018-22 (or latest available data depending on the source. This may require that the report be updated if new data is released).
• Provide the OME with an analysis of the data, as they relate to the civilian sector, an assessment of how they have changed since 2017, and an assessment of which components are the most highly valued in the civilian sector.
• Provide the OME with an assessment of which of these data sources are likely to be available for use in future reviews of the level of X-Factor.

• Broader use of clinical skills within the 'consult and complete' model

The contract would start from 1 June 2022.

The COVID pandemic, with the consequent need to focus resource on managing repeated waves and subsequent, ongoing recovery and restoration priorities have caused a delay in re-commissioning Tier 3 Bariatric services across Sussex, which we had intended to undertake during the 20/21 financial year. We now anticipate undertaking a procurement in the early part of 22/23 and preparation for this is underway.

Tier 3 weight management service provision aims to:

• To provide an alternative to surgical intervention

• To prepare patients adequately if a surgical intervention is required

• To improve health outcomes in severely obese patients

• To provide a maintenance plan for patients who are exiting the service

To provide a service for patients who meet the referral criteria

• To improve health outcomes in severely obese patients

• To reduce the health burden of obesity

In order to ensure that there is no break in service availability for current patients, many of whom would have only recently commenced lengthy pathways, we intend to renew the current Tier 3 weight management contracts in East Sussex (High Weald Lewes & Havens) and West Sussex CCG (for North West and Mid Sussex) with TBC Healthcare Ltd for 22 months, and in West Sussex CCG (for Coastal West Sussex) with Sussex Medical Chambers Ltd, also for 22 months. Where these contracts are superseded by contracts arising from the planned procurement, they will be terminated early in accordance with the contractual terms and conditions and in the best interests of patients.
Contract values are as follows:

TBC Healthcare Ltd:
East Sussex CCG (old HLWH CCG area) = £227,490
West Sussex CCG (for North West and Mid Sussex) = £823,405

Sussex Medical Chambers Ltd:

WWF-UK is calling for research consultant proposals to deliver technical and summary reports answering the research questions:
1) What is the 'food footprint' of the UK (and England, Wales and Scotland) - i.e. the contribution of the UK/nations' food system to the UK's global footprint (the environmental pressures and impact of UK production and consumption)?
2) What should the UK (and England, Wales and Scotland) food footprint reduction targets be for 2030 and 2050 to align with the targets of a) reducing the UK's Global Footprint by three-quarters by 2030, b) achieving UK net-zero by 2050 and c) halting and reversing the loss of UK biodiversity by 2030?
3) What are the relative impacts of stakeholder actions (inc. consumers, farmers/fishers, businesses, governments) to reduce the UK's food footprint?
4) What are the economic, social, health and environmental cost-benefits of these actions and the jeopardy of stakeholders not taking them?
5) What is the relative potential impact of each stakeholder group to reduce the UK's food footprint?

In order to achieve this Dorset Council's Adults and Housing Directorate is opening a new Framework; this will act as a vehicle to procure a range of care and support, housing and community safety services. It will replace the existing Frameworks.
The Dorset Care, Support, Housing and Community Safety Framework will be established by utilising the flexibilities of the Light Touch Regime under the Public Contract Regulations 2015. These enable Public Sector Bodies, in terms of health and social care, to adapt and innovate procurement and contracting models to best meet service requirements.
The Framework will be in place for up to 10 years and will enable providers to join at any time (as long as specific criteria is met) instead of fixed opening periods (as is the case with the existing Frameworks). It will work in two stages as follows:
• Part I: The overarching 10 year framework will open and detail specific lots. At this stage providers need to meet the minimum entry criteria, this is detailed when the framework is open. At this stage providers will be asked to complete minimum entry criteria for the Lots they may in future wish to participate in further competitions for.
• In Part 2 providers will be invited further competition which will include further quality / price evaluation processes in respect of ""specific call off""s. It is anticipated that this process will commence from April 2022.
The Framework shall allow a variety of procurement methods in order to support flexibility; opportunities to expand Providers' geographical reaches and to respond to the needs of Service Users in receipt of Direct Payments or Personal Health Budgets. These shall include but are not limited to:

• Brokerage of individual packages
• Fixed term block contracts
• Individual Service Funds (ISF)

The Framework shall remain open for providers to apply to be appointed onto the Framework at any time during the Term, including those who have previously applied and failed to become a Framework provider (but excluding any whose Framework Agreement and/or Call-Off Contract has been terminated for Contract Non-Compliance). Framework providers may re-apply to improve their standing on the Framework by applying to be appointed to additional Lots.",https://procontract.due-north.com/Advert?advertId=0ba433c5-30a9-ec11-8112-005056b64545&p=696a9836-1895-e511-8105-000c29c9ba21,Tom Smith,"Dorset Council

UKAEA is supporting this endeavour as the design and operational authority running the Joint European Torus (JET), ITER's predecessor situated at Culham, in the UK. Through JET, UKAEA has developed key capabilities that have been deployed to design, manufacture qualify, and supply high-specification windows for ITER's containment structure.
3.2. The fused silica windows required by ITER must be qualified to work under the nuclear codes defined by the ITER Organisation (IO). In order to do this, a programme of qualification has been devised to test the raw fused silica material, the material coated with an anti-reflective substance, and the final window assemblies in succession, thereby demonstrating that the materials and design of the windows are compliant with the nuclear codes (RCC-MR 2007) specified by IO and suitable for ITER operations.
3.3. This document serves as the requirements specification for the procurement of the raw fused silica for this qualification campaign. It includes all material specimens required for each phase of the campaign, and specifies in detail the material grades, dimensions, tolerances, acceptable inclusions, performance characteristics, and quantities for each batch of parts.
3.4. All parts described by this document are for the qualification campaign only. If the qualification campaign is successful, a follow-on procurement activity will be launched to acquire fused silica for the production of the ITER windows themselves.",https://uk.eu-supply.com/app/rfq/rwlentrance_s.asp?PID=45049&B=UK,Abigail Woods,"Culham Science Centre

Within the CRP, the EFSI Project would seek to establish a national process for evaluation that includes a compendium of evaluation methodologies, tools, and guidance to evaluate intervention activities and ensure UK Fire Rescue Service has a consistent, robust, valid, and reliable evidence base that can justify the Community Risk Management Plan. These methodologies would take account of protection, prevention, and response activities as well as their inevitable interdependency as it relates to effective risk mitigation.

The Bristol Dental School is currently integrated and collocated with the Bristol Dental Hospital, which is run by the Universities Hospitals Bristol & Weston NHS Foundation Trust. As such, the IT systems currently used by the Dental School to facilitate clinical practice are those used by, and provided by, the NHS Trust.

The intention of the New Dental School project is to separate the University's Dental School both physically and operationally from the Dental Hospital and the NHS Trust, creating a separate and independent Dental School and clinical facility based at a new dedicated location within Bristol.

In conjunction with this move, the Dental School's operating model will be redefined to deliver enhancements to the quality of clinical education along with significant improvements to student, staff and patient experience.

By separating from the NHS Trust, and the Dental Hospital, the New Dental School will need to procure a number of new IT systems to support the clinical practice elements of the school.

This procurement is specifically for the provision of Patient Administration System (PAS) software.

The system is used to provide a secure, high bandwidth storage solution to enable post production of student digital media work using software applications such as Avid Media Composer, Avid Protools, Blackmagic Davinci Resolve, Adobe Premiere, Adobe After Effects.

The infrastructure is currently the backbone to almost 60 workstation clients that support learning and teaching across a number of subject areas including Film and TV production, Media and Journalism, Film and TV studies, Film Foundation Fine Art, Graphic Design. The faculty also has an ambition to grow its postgraduate offering in Film and Media related subjects and engage in partnerships with external production companies that may also use the facilities.

Interplay/ production management was added to the current ISIS primarily to support the Journalism degree and provide access to Media Composer Cloud for students. The Journalism degree is no longer in operation and the University now runs a Citrix remote access solution to access workstations on Campus.

The current workstation breakdown consists of:
•54 x hp z440 workstations. These are split across computer labs and bookable editing booths
•1 x Mac Pro within a Colour Grading suite
•1x Mac Pro within a Audio Suite
•
All workstations contain dual network cards. In November 2021 the University simplified its workflow to just using the ISIS without the workgroup facility to allow segregation from the campus to fulfil Cyber Essentials due to the old OS of the ISIS Hardware.

The purpose of this Prior Information Notice (PIN) is to invite organisations to participate in market engagement to:

- establish supplier interest in;
- obtain market insights about and
- explore commercial options for

the delivery of the Initial Teacher Training (ITT) Scholarships programme starting in Oct 2022 to recruit to the AY2023/24 cohort.

The ITT Scholarships programme was introduced in 2012 and is one of a range of initiatives to boost teacher supply in priority subjects currently chemistry, computing, mathematics and physics. ITT Scholarships are awarded to the most talented trainees in priority subjects.

The current strategic objectives of the programme are to:
· Improve the quality of the teaching workforce by attracting applicants who:

o have an excellent understanding of their subject and the ability to explain it to pupils,
o are committed to teaching and
o have the personal attributes to make them a good classroom teacher.

Raise the status of the teaching profession.

·Increase teacher supply by attracting high-quality applicants who might not otherwise have considered teaching as a viable career option.

·Attract as many high-quality applicants as possible through a targeted marketing campaign and encourage these applicants to progress to ITT whether they are awarded a scholarship or not.

·Maximise retention across the scholarships cohort by ensuring alumni have continued support and links with the wider professional community in their early careers.

·Establish communities of scholars who will continue to have a positive impact inside and outside of education as their careers progress.

·Share best practice and pool resources with the other subject associations involved in scholarships in order to utilise economies of scale and improve recruitment.

We are keen to learn what the market can offer trainees by way of a scholarship package that complements their ITT; utilises their subject expertise to benefit pupils and schools; shapes the early career development of a subject expert teacher; and supports teacher retention in the profession.

The budget for the programme is currently subject to approval. Further details will be provided should we proceed with a procurement process for the programme.",https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/Attachment/67da3aed-fa66-4eeb-b2b2-d424e59adeb0,-,"Department for Education Piccadilly Gate Store Street Manchester

Scheme background

The Government has committed more than £750 million to a Nature for Climate Fund, including for peat restoration and tree planting programmes. As part of this, Natural England (NE) is delivering the Nature for Climate Peatland Grant Scheme (NCPGS). This competitive scheme will run from 2021 to 2025.

The NCPGS aims to:

- set 35,000 ha of degraded peatland in England on a path to restoration by March 2025
- reduce emissions from peat by 9 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent by 2050, with continued reductions after that

These targets are linked to the England Peat Action Plan. Peatland restoration will also deliver wider environmental and social benefits. It will: contribute to the Nature Recovery Network (NRN); enhance ecosystems and biodiversity; improve water quality; provide natural flood management; protect the historic environment; give opportunities for people to connect with nature.

The NCPGS includes the Restoration Grant and the Discovery Grant. This project is for Round 2 of the Restoration Grant which will fund peatland restoration and its associated eligible costs. The Restoration Grant is a multi-year grant and funds are intended for projects where there is a complete programme of restoration works identified for at least the first year of the agreement.

The Restoration Grant provides up to 75% of total project costs.",https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/Attachment/b80fba41-9ec4-4b24-ad12-e009c16bee9e,"Please address email correspondence with the subject heading- NCF Peatland Restoration, Notice Enquiry, Your Organisation Name","17 Smith Square, Nobel House

Sandgate Parish Council currently holds a long lease for the public library and parish office premises in Sandgate High Street.
Improvement of access to the building for all is important to the Parish Council. This includes extending the use of the premises for more community activities and events. We have a number of issues we wish to resolve.
1. Currently the building's entrance doorway is unwelcoming and difficult to use for those in and with buggies, prams, wheelchairs and mobility issues. We are seeking to improve that by repositioning and replacing the front door, lighting and door opening mechanism.
2. The only toilet in the building is currently not for public use and is inaccessible for those with mobility issues. The toilet and its access needs to be remodelled to make it accessible to all.
3. In addition, we have limited storage in the library. it is proposed that a large built in secure storage area is installed to the rear of the library to extend along the back wall with shelving and sliding doors.
We would be pleased to receive quotations for these works from local suppliers. We would prefer quotations for all 3 of the works above, but are happy to consider options with a variety of local contractors working together.
Please arrange an appointment to come and view the proposed works before tending a quotation. Contractors will have to have all relevant insurances and references for similar works.

Acting on behalf of Supply Chain Coordination Limited (SCCL), a Management Function of NHS Supply Chain, the Collaborative Procurement Partnership LLP (CPP) provides a framework for 'Aids for Daily Living' which runs until 31 October 2023 with work currently ongoing to plan for a replacement framework. A contract notice is to be issued on 1 November 2022.

The NHS requires an innovative integrated solution for the provision of high-quality walking aids to support the re-use of these products and is looking to build the re-use of crutches, walking sticks, Zimmer frames, rollators within the NHS Supply Chain framework for 'Aids for Daily Living'

NHS Supply Chain and its customers are using this opportunity to fundamentally re-think the requirements and explore alternative delivery models to support the delivery of a Greener NHS.

Walking aids are provided on a need&apos;s basis by a range of healthcare specialists including physiotherapists, occupational therapists, fracture and orthopaedic clinics, A&E, outpatient departments and diabetic foot clinics. They can also be supplied through community hospitals and social care. Some services are likely to have repeat visits from patients allowing easier return/collection, other clinics such as A&E may not have return visits by patients making collection and return more difficult.

Two categories of walking aid users can be distinguished:
1. Long-term users (patients that are given aids and will typically keep them until the equipment or patients no longer needing the item)
2. Short-term users (patients are given aids for example as part of post-surgery, post-accident rehabilitation)",https://www.find-tender.service.gov.uk/Notice/007502-2022?,-,"Foxbridge Way

The CPCA intends to procure high quality adult education and training. CPCA are seeking to build effective contractual relationships and continue to implement local flexibilities through our devolution agreement. Successful training providers will deliver contracts for services that meet our quality standards and delivery expectations aligned to the skills needs of the CPCA region. Through the tendering process successful providers will demonstrate an understanding of our local authority areas, the needs of resident learners and employers, and how they would work alongside our FE Colleges and Local Authority grant funded organisations to add value to the local curriculum offer for CPCA residents.

From the 2019/20 academic year, the CPCA has held responsibility for the regions share of devolved Adult Education Budget (AEB) and how it is delivered. The AEB aims to engage adults and provide them with the skills and learning needed for work or further learning. In addition, it will improve employability skills including communication, self-confidence and attitude to work and enable people to contribute to the social wellbeing of their community.

In addition to the AEB, further government funding from the National Skills Fund: Level 3 adult Offer has been delegated to the CPCA for Level 3 Courses for the 2022/23 academic year.

The CPCAs vision is to increase skills and career progression through a network of providers operating as a 'skills escalator', in enabling adults to increase their skills levels, their productivity, and quality of life, by progressing from lower to higher levels of learning and earnings.

A headline focus of this Commissioning round is to:
• Increase the proportion of Peterborough and Fenland residents with a Level 3 qualification
• Reduce the number of Peterborough and Fenland residents with no formal qualifications
• Target residents living in the relatively most deprived postcodes in the sub-regions, including wider Cambridgeshire and parts of Cambridge City

CPCAs overall commissioning approach will involve a combination of plan-led commissioning with grant providers and procured provision delivered through Contract for Services. This opportunity is concerned solely with procured activity.

We expect that funding for the new Multiply program will be allocated to the CPCA for a three-year period from 2022/23 - 2024-25 academic year.

Brief Description of the requirement:

Aims
This study aims to identify current evidence in the land use and agricultural sectors, and evidence gaps in order to frame and develop a much larger programme of research. Furthermore, it will set out the available options to achieve net zero (or better) in agriculture and land use within the constraints of government's legal requirements, policy ambitions and aspirations. It aims to assess the implications of these potential solutions to identify which pathways are most acceptable to policy and public. The study should be undertaken and presented at UK scale.

The outputs of the scoping study will inform the development of a much larger, multi-annual cross Defra/BEIS research platform to further develop evidence in this space via targeted primary research, and the development of new data sets, tools and integrated models. This project will be separately tendered in lieu of the results of the present study.

UKRI has announced a consultation on the organisation's draft Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) Strategy.

The EDI strategy sets out UKRI's ambition for an inclusive research and innovation system and our long-term commitment to achieving this aim. The development of the strategy has been driven by wide-ranging engagement, discussion, and challenge from a wide variety of individuals and organisations with UKRI and its councils.

The strategy outlines our ambition for a research and innovation system where:
• everyone feels included, is heard, respected, and able to be their real self
• different people, ideas, ways of thinking, skills, and perspectives are valued
• people and ideas thrive, are supported, and encouraged
• everyone can participate in, contribute to, and benefit from our investments in research, and innovation.

An open consultation on the strategy was launched on 13 January and will close on 28 March 2022. The consultation is open to anyone. We want everybody's voice to be heard. The consultation welcomes responses from anyone interested or involved in research and innovation, either as an individual, organisation or group to inform the refinement of the strategy and development of future action plans and measures. We expect to publish our first edition of the strategy in summer 2022.

Please ensure you review all attached information to ensure a full understanding of this requirement. All attachments can be found with the Document Uploads tab within the Delta eSourcing Portal.

The National Quantum Computing Centre aims at building quantum computers which will be made available to end users. Among others, one of the hardware platforms we are developing is based on trapped ions. In trapped ions quantum computing, lasers are used to interact with the internal states of a single and multiple ions. Depending on the chosen ion species and internal states, specific laser frequencies are used. The precise wavelength/frequency of these lasers needs to be calibrated to a high degree to allow them to interact with the ions.
To this end, a high accuracy Wavelength Measurement System is needed which can measure the frequency of a laser with an absolute frequency uncertainty of 20 MHz or below (lower is better).

The availability of alternative crisis provision would also complement other potential service improvements, such as Mental Health Response Vehicles operating within the Borough and mental health practitioners being located within the Ambulance Services Emergency Operating Centre.

The service will provide to:

People contacting Single Point of Access where triage has assessed that they are appropriate to access a community-based / virtual solution to managing the initial crisis. Many of these people will have identifiable triggers such as relationship break down etc, or people known to services that are experiencing a decline in mood and mental wellbeing

People presenting at A&E that are assessed as not requiring detention through the Mental Health Act but do require a level of support and assistance to manage the presenting crisis

People known to mental health services where the care team has identified a decline in wellbeing and would benefit from additional evening / weekend support to assist with the crisis period to reduce the risk of admission

People presenting to services with low level mental health decline but requiring support to prevent escalation

The criteria for referral needs to be clear on maintaining its focus to support the people identified. Clarity needs to be established on the limitations of the service from the outset

The priority inequality cohorts in Barnsley are:

Males

BAME (Black Asian and Minority Ethnic) Community

People in the most deprived areas of Barnsley (e.g., Dearne Valley, Central)

Isolated Adults

The Contract will be for a term of 3 years with the opportunity to extend for a further 2 years subject to mutual agreement between the successful Bidder and the Authority.

DO NOT apply directly to the buyer.

All tender information MUST be submitted through the Delta eSourcing Portal.

Brief Description of Requirement

In 2013, recognising the importance of wheat research, BBSRC developed a five-year wheat strategy under the chairmanship of Sir David Baulcombe. The strategy highlighted the importance of consolidating and building upon BBSRC's and the UK's track record in wheat research and noted that BBSRC has a major international leadership role to play.
In 2015, a BBSRC Council Wheat Sub-group was set up to discuss the strategic role BBSRC should play in UK wheat research. The group was chaired by Professor Helen Sang and also included Sir David Baulcombe to provide continuity from the strategy development work. BBSRC Council subsequently endorsed a vision for wheat research and a series of recommendations to maintain and build on the UK's strategic wheat research capability. It is also important to recognise the international benefits of research undertaken in the UK. Much knowledge generated from UK research, especially at the more fundamental level, has global relevance, and research results generated in one country can be used in another.

Over the past ten years, BBSRC has invested c. £210m in innovative wheat research, often in collaboration with other UK and international organisations. Much of this pioneering research is led by teams at institutes strategically supported by BBSRC, who are helping to create higher yielding and more resilient wheat crops to provide global food security in the face of a growing population and a changing climate.

BBSRC's investments are supporting the UK's ambition to be a world leader in the research necessary to underpin sustainable wheat production. The wheat research portfolio will underpin the development of future generations of wheat crops, agronomic systems and industrial processes that will allow wheat to be grown and used more sustainably, whilst maintaining or improving yields and quality traits.

strategic importance to the Council. The vision for the area is for a mixed-use,
pedestrian friendly quarter that reflects the distinctive character of Winchester
City Centre, supports a vibrant retail and cultural / heritage offer which is set
within an exceptional public realm and incorporates the imaginative re-use of
existing buildings. This vision is set out within the Central Winchester
Regeneration Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) 2018 and a Development
Brief (included with procurement documents and available for unrestricted and
full direct electronic access, free of charge. Use the link below under
'More Information' to access).

The Council is seeking to procure a development partner to turn this vision
into reality. It is critical that the development partner shares the passion for
transformational development that is sensitive to the heritage of an ancient
cathedral City and is prepared to commit for the long term. Commitment to
sustainability and engagement across Winchester's varied communities is
also required.

The site (as detailed in the procurement documents) is located in the heart
of the City and includes the bus station, Kings Walk, Coitbury House,
Friarsgate car park and the old Friarsgate Medical Centre. The site comprises
circa 3.68 acres (1.49 ha) of land and consists of two separate boundaries.

The indicative GIA mix of uses comprise:
Circa 180,000 sq ft of residential of which a minimum of 40% is to be
affordable;
Circa 80,000 sq ft of mixed-use space;
Circa 25,000 sq ft of retail and F&B space.

The Council is seeking to procure a development partner to enter into a
development agreement under the terms of which the development partner
will undertake to deliver the overall development on a phased basis, and
in accordance with the SPD and Development Brief. The development
partner will be appointed to carry out design and planning, community
engagement and consultation, and all other preparatory activities prior
to the draw-down of each phase (by way of long lease). The scheme
will require the delivery of all enabling infrastructure as well as exemplary
public realm. The long-term stewardship, management, curation and
activation of the completed scheme is equally essential.

The estimated lowest and highest values shown above are an expression
of the estimated gross development value.

The three local authorities want to develop a new model for strategic collaboration with providers of residential care to improve outcomes for the children and young people. We wish to achieve this by working in partnership with providers to cultivate a fresh approach that fully employs their knowledge, expertise and creativity.

The children and young people we are seeking placements for are:

o Aged 8- 17 (though more typically 10-16)
o May have often experienced exploitation - criminal and or sexual
o Have had long histories of neglect and exposure to domestic abuse and other forms of childhood trauma
o Have a limited capacity to make secure and healthy attachments with care givers due to blocked trust
o Have mental health needs which have not always been fully assessed or understood
o Will sometimes need to be placed in an emergency/immediate situation

We have already undertaken some initial market research and from this we know that to be successful we will need to offer long contracts (10 years plus), develop a realistic approach to matching children to places and have pragmatic timescales for mobilisation and the required placements becoming available.

To realise our ambition for a real partnership we want to explore with interested Service Providers a range of issues including - how 'soft blocks' can work in a way that is fair to both the provider and local authority partners?

The market engagement event is scheduled for Tuesday 5th April 2022 at 12-2 pm. If you would like to attend the event, you must reply by sending a message via the portal indicating your interest and provide the names and email addresses of attendees by the 1st April at 12pm.

The aim of the program is to provide an opportunity for companies funded by the Sustainable Innovation Fund to raise equity finance from business angels and venture capital investors. We envisage this program supporting a cohort of up to 20 companies. Companies will be selected through a competitive process co-designed with the selected supplier. We expect to work with companies raising between  500,000 -  5,000,000.

The program will provide training and support to companies over a series of workshops. The support should help teams prepare, navigate, and execute on their fundraising campaign. A showcase or series of showcase events will provide a platform to allow the cohort to pitch towards the investment community.

The program has quantitive KPIs focusing on the number of connections between the cohort and selected investors and the value of investment raised. We will also conduct a monitoring and evaluation process following the program including net promoter score. Our qualitative KPIs focus on improving individual companies' ""readiness"" relating to raising risk capital.

Scope of proposals and deliverables required

Proposals should focus on developing and leading an end-to-end investment readiness program to support a maximum of 20 SMEs from the Sustainable Innovation Fund.

We envisage proposals to address the following but not limited to:

• Program design and structure
• Support with the application and company selection phase
• Workshops and training preparation for the selected cohort
• In-person investor showcase
• Marketing and investment community outreach

We actively seek creative proposals addressing the mentioned areas above and encourage potential suppliers to think uniquely how they can deliver an industry leading program.

Proposals should outline how they will address each area outlined above and are welcome to design a curriculum to support. We welcome workshops and sessions to be designed creatively and collaboratively across the ecosystem to provide the right tailored support.

Innovate UK KTN will support with the communications towards the Sustainable Innovation Fund applicants in collaboration with the selected supplier.

Proposals should include all costs relating to the program from preparation, program design, marketing and venue and catering costs.

We anticipate receiving single company proposals; however, we envisage that collaborative approaches between 2 organisations may also enable a strong balance to deliver on the topic and are open to this. Proposals should be submitted as one if partnering and outline each other's elements to the proposal.

CIMT has an extensive website of mathematical resources for teachers and learners that is widely used around the world. All resources on the website have always been freely available since the site's inception in 1995.

The goal of this project is to work with an external expert/s to develop a viable plan that will unlock the value and commercial potential of the CIMT and in so doing ensure its long-term sustainability.
Whilst we are clear on the drivers for this work, we are open minded as to how the commercialization of CIMT is achieved, and would be willing to consider a range options from, for example, exploiting specific areas of Intellectual Property to develop new products or services, to the spinning-out of a new legal entity and seeking external investment through which to scale.

Following this project the CIMT Steering Group should be well positioned to commercialise the CIMT offer with a clear understanding of the product, market, competitors and opportunities with the knowledge needed to identify and approach investors in order to secure their investment into CIMT and its products for the future.",https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/Attachment/6223205f-a88a-46a1-9404-52a7fbeebc88,Procurement Team,"Drake Circus

It operates three chain ferries linking Plymouth with South East Cornwall, each vessel has a length of 48 metres and breadth of 20 metres and can carry up to 73 cars and 140 foot passengers.

Every five years each of the three Torpoint ferries requires a mandatory dry docking to allow a survey of the underwater hull to ensure the material state is sufficient to safely last a further five years, to enable classification society and Marine Coastguard Agency surveys together with essential maintenance and modifications.

Cornwall Council is leading this procurement to procure ferry refits on behalf of its Joint Authority owners in accordance with the Public Contract Regulations 2015 and the Open Tender procedure, with the intention to let a framework contract covering three refits taking place in April 2023, April 2024 and April 2025. The contracted work package for each refit to include the tow from Torpoint to the refitting shipyard and the return and the refits cycle time should be no greater than 30 calendar days from removal of each Ferry from its chains to reinstatement and full return to service.

The objective is to provide a period in dry dock for essential dock dependent ferry maintenance and modifications together with inspections of other key equipment and systems by Lloyds Register, a third party quality assurance organisation. This statutory requirement and satisfactory completion is required before the issue of a Chain Ferry Certificate by the regulatory authority, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. The aim at the completion of a refit is to provide a ferry that is of a sufficient material state to allow issue of a Chain Ferry Certificate and give five years high availability operational service without significant breakdown or other major maintenance requirements in line with the specification.

Tamar Bridge and Torpoint Ferry Joint Committee (TB&TF) will provide the technical supervisory role at the refit location. There will be a requirement to integrate TB&TF staff maintenance activity, within the overarching refit project management plan.

The total fund of £10.6m over the five year strategy includes £10m of National Lottery funding, with the remaining £0.6m coming from non-Lottery sources. They are divided between the following programmes: the Film Export Fund, UK Film-focussed activity at International Festivals and Markets, International Projects, and British Film Commission support. In addition for the financial year 2020-21, an exceptional one-off COVID-19 UK Sales Support programme was available, providing pandemic-related mitigation support. From 2017-2021, the International Fund received 205 applications and made 174 awards to circa 80 different organisations.

The approach should cover both process and impact evaluation. It should consider each of the funding strands independently, how they do or do not complement one another and how they contribute to delivering the BFI2022 International Strategy. Particular attention should be paid to the British Film Commission funding, which represents a distinct and flagship element of the International Fund's work.

The contractor must have a valid SSIP Accreditation.

The building was designed by H B Robson, Architect to the Dock and Railway Company to a classical architectural style.
The stone for the building was provided from local quarries by the Dock and Railway Company. It was built and opened in 1852 as the West Hartlepool Mechanics Literary Institute.
In 1890 the building was extended on Lynn Street to accommodate a new shop; however there was an issue in obtaining stone to match the existing and as a result stone was sourced and obtained from Tadcaster. The difference in the stone colour is evident to the Lynn Street elevation and indicated in the photographs.
The roof has been extended and altered many times since its construction as a detached building and this is typified by the arrangement of offshoots of varied construction to the rear of the building.
The construction of the building varies but is predominantly of dolomitic limestone and brickwork, external walls with pitched and flat roofs. The original roof coverings have been replaced with interlocking concrete tiles and single ply pvc membranes whilst the rainwater goods vary from the original cast iron to the later plastic. Internally the floors are suspended timber construction and internal walls are a mixture of solid loadbearing masonry and non-loadbearing timber construction.
The windows are all painted softwood casement and sash windows predominantly single glazing and are not suspected as being original to the building.

The property is Grade II Listed (Dec 1985) and is within a Conservation Area and therefore subject to special planning constraints.

The work includes: - • General stonework repairs • Cleaning of stonework • Repointing of stonework • Replacement of timber floor joists • Replacement of rainwater goods • Stich cracking repairs 3 • Lintel repair work • Treatment of corroded iron beam • Replacement of windows • Replacement of kiosk shop front • Installation of new signage • Redecoration works.

All areas of the building will remain open and in continuous use by staff, members and visitors throughout the contract period.

DO NOT apply directly to the buyer.

All tender information MUST be submitted through the Delta eSourcing Portal.

Brief Description of Requirement

The Future Research Assessment Programme has been initiated at the request of UK and devolved government ministers and funding bodies. This significant piece of work is led by the four UK higher education funding bodies (Research England, Scottish Funding Council, Higher Education Funding Council for Wales and Department for the Economy, NI) and aims to explore possible approaches to the assessment of UK higher education research performance.

One strand of the programme involves reviewing the costs and benefits of REF 2021 for Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) and comparing them with those reported for REF 2014 and the RAE 2008 (available from Technopolis Group » REF Accountability Review: Costs, benefits and burden (technopolis-group.com) , Preparing impact submissions for REF 2014: An evaluation: Approach and Evidence | RAND and Preparing impact submissions for REF 2014: An evaluation: Findings and observations | RAND) where applicable.

This project should enable funding bodies and HEIs to understand how the balance of costs - against benefits played out in REF 2021 and the impact of changes made between REF 2014 and REF 2021. These insights will contribute towards policy development for future research assessment exercises.

To meet the requirements of this project, the project will involve working with a representative sample of HEIs to identify how REF submission preparation was managed within institutions, deriving suitable and robust methodologies for gathering quantitative and qualitative data, and analysing them. It will also be necessary to compare the findings between the different REF exercises in a consistent and fair manner; accounting for or explaining gaps in the analysis where it was not possible to make comparisons and explaining the reasons for such judgements.

Please ensure you review all attached information to ensure a full understanding of this requirement. All attachments can be found with the Document Uploads tab within the Delta eSourcing Portal.

This contract will be awarded based on the evaluation criteria as set out in the RFP document.

The National Quantum Computing Centre aims at building quantum computers which will be made available to end users. Among others, one of the hardware platforms we are developing is based on trapped ions. In trapped ions quantum computing, lasers are used to interact with the internal states of a single and multiple ions. Depending on the chosen ion species and internal states, specific laser frequencies are used. In order to implement operations with lasers, the lasers need to be permanently frequency stabilised.

The standard way to achieve the required stability is to reference each laser to a pair of mirrors - which form a cavity. The distance between the mirrors is fixed in length and can be made to be stable enough to act as the required reference.

This tender is aimed at the purchase of a (single) set of cavities used to stabilise a number of lasers The delivery of the cavities must be before the 1st of September 2022, which is fundamental to the success of the project.

To effectively oversee the grant process, we seek to embed an online system that can manage all grants from tender through management and be used for a variety of programme-wide performance analysis and evaluation purposes. The maximum budget available for this online grant management system is £100,000.

The online grant management system will be required to support numerous functions of the grant process and provide management and oversight in a user-friendly format, for use by Local Authorities and VCS organisations. This will begin at grant application and award, through ongoing performance and financial management.

The system will, in the first instance, be used for the London Crime Prevention Fund (LCPF) which is split into two strands: direct funding and VRU uplift. These two strands have different deliverables, but both provide grant funding to 32 Local Authorities in London.

In addition to the online system, we require resource support to set these LCPF programmes up and migrate existing data, by the end of June 2022. A new round of funding begins in the next financial year. The intention is then that MOPAC and the VRU will be self-sufficient in setting up other grant programmes going forward.

Brief Description of Requirement

The Low Pay Commission (LPC) invites tenders for a study to assess the impact of the recent increases in the National Living Wage (NLW) (and the National Minimum Wage (NMW)), including on young people.
We are keen to understand the impact of the recent unprecedented upheaval in the economy and the labour market caused by measures to control the global pandemic. This has affected some sectors, in particular many low-paying sectors, more than others. It has also disrupted many of the usual data sources upon which much of our standard analysis depends. The pandemic has, however, also led to the development of new data sources. We are therefore keen to consider tenders that can take advantage of these.

All tender information MUST be submitted through the Delta eSourcing Portal.

Brief Description of Requirement

The Low Pay Commission (LPC) invites tenders from researchers to assess the impacts of the Accommodation Offset of the National Minimum Wage on the supply and demand for employer-provided accommodation.
This research will inform the LPC's review of the Accommodation Offset and the factors that will inform the Accommodation Offset framework in the future.
When the NMW was first introduced, Commissioners recommended accommodation as the only benefit-in-kind that could count towards the NMW. The policy intent of the offset is to recognise that accommodation is a benefit to both workers and employers, so it is acceptable that employers make some deduction for it, but that this does not cover the total actual cost of providing accommodation. Commissioners were concerned that, in the absence of an offset, employers might begin to charge high rates for this accommodation, disadvantaging the low paid.

The aim is to create an urgent & emergency care system capable of delivering equitable access to the right care, first time for patients through a networked model with services provided along robust pathways 24/7. UTCs form an important access point on this network with key interdependencies with ED's, Primary Care, NHS 111, London Ambulance Service (LAS), Rapid Response, GP Out of Hours.

Key Service Requirements: Our UTC's have to integrate with health and non-health services across NWL. Providers will be required to work collaboratively with local stakeholders and develop shared pathways across primary and secondary care. It is essential that the UTC provider(s) particularly develop strong relationships with primary care, secondary care, out of hours services and NHS 111.

An integrated service model is fundamental with close integration with ED's and other health services via formal governance mechanisms & strong informal working relationships.

Providers will be expected to develop an operating model that supports the following principles:
-Partnership with the acute provider(s), including working together in periods of high & low demand and access to specialist input.
-A Joint Clinical Governance Group to foster joint working and drive continuous improvement.
-Work across organisational interfaces - including developing policies, processes and procedures jointly between the UTC and ED
-Ensures that IT systems are interoperable so that patient details will not have to be taken again in the event of streaming/transfer to Trust ED
-Deliver appropriate access to diagnostics & specialities provided within each Acute.

The CCG currently has contract arrangements in place with Totally Plc & Hounslow & Richmond Community Trust (HRCH) to provide the above services. The contract term expires on 31st March 2022. The CCG is considering options for making future arrangements for these services and is looking to tender the opportunity, for a contract period of 3 years. The contract value is approximately £24,000,000/annum. The purpose of this PIN is to be transparent about the CCG's intentions and to invite any capable provider interested in delivering the services described above to come forward by 14 April 2022 to engage with the CCG.

If it is that Totally Plc and Hounslow & Richmond Community Trust (HRCH) are the only provider capable of delivering the services described, then the CCG will look to award a further contract to those organisations for up to 12mths beyond April 2022.

Whilst the CCG considers its procurement options for these services going forward, it may extend its arrangements with the current provider(s) until a new contract is awarded.

During 2022, it is anticipated that NWL CCG will be succeeded by an Integrated Care Board (ICB). Any future contract and/or procurement opportunity may therefore be in the name of ICB.",-,NWL CCG Contracts Team,"15 Marylebone Road

The overarching aim of this project is to transform our local care market and have a really positive impact on life outcomes for our citizens. Our ambition is that people with LD&A in Bristol can:

- enjoy independence,
- live as close to home as possible in communities where they feel valued,
- have choice around how they spend their time, and
- contribute to the local neighbourhood.

Currently we place too many people with LD&A in distant, out-of-area accommodation far from their home communities. The local market is not currently providing a diverse, sustainable and innovative range of care options and accommodation to meet local needs.

The Council's model of care needs to be financially sustainable and be delivered within the resources available. We are looking for longer term partners who can work with us on this agenda and support us to develop innovative models that deliver the right care in the most cost-effective way.

In order to achieve this the Council recognises the need to attract and retain excellent providers in the City that are appropriately rewarded in order to build sustainable businesses and provide a diverse range of care of an excellent standard. We are looking to build long term partnerships with providers who put prevention, reablement and recovery at the heart of what they do and are committed to ensuring people have choice and control over the services they receive with just enough support to live independent lives. We are also committed to working in close partnership with people who use these services and their families in developing new models of care and support and we would expect our provider market to support this approach of partnership, cooperation and innovation.

We are holding a market engagement event on Wednesday 27 April, from 13:30 - 16:30 via Microsoft Teams where we will be considering different options as to how we structure Bristol's market model, and you are invited to take part in this event to contribute your views and expertise.

Please take this opportunity to express an interest and get involved in this exciting piece of soft market testing.

Licence holders have the legal right to challenge in court DVLA's medical clinical decision where DVLA have revoked or refused a licence. The customer can apply for a short period driving licence to be issued but may still challenge the revocation or refusal. Such challenges are considered appeal cases and currently DMG receive 450 appeal cases per annum. This is expected to rise to 500-600 over the next 3 years based on current business projections.

Drivers who have had their driving entitlement revoked for medical reasons have a right to appeal against the decision under Section 100 of the Road Traffic Act 1988. This is explained in correspondence sent by the Agency to the driver at the time the driving entitlement is withdrawn. In England and Wales this must be done by way of complaint to a local Magistrates Court within six months of the revocation of or refusal to grant a driving licence. There are different rules for Scotland but these are outside the scope of this procurement. We are currently considering a service for England and Wales which will be split into geographical lots according to the location of magistrate courts.

The procurement is being conducted in accordance with the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 and is subject to the light-touch regime under Section 7 Social and Other Specific Services. Under Regulation 76 the Council is free to establish a procedure, provided that procedure is sufficient to ensure compliance with the principles of transparency and equal treatment of economic operators.
We are inviting applications for funding from experienced and qualified organisations to provide free places at holiday clubs during the summer and Christmas school holidays in 2022. Providers can apply for summer and Christmas or only summer or only Christmas. This funding will be dispensed from the Holiday Activities and Food programme grant that has been allocated to LB Newham by the Department for Education.
These holiday club places will provide children with at least one nutritious meal each day, as well as a range of physical, educational and enriching activities. This programme is targeted at school-aged children from reception to year 11 (inclusive) who receive benefits-related free school meals.
A small number of free or subsidised holiday club places will be for children and young people who are not in receipt of benefits-related free school meals, but who the local authority believe would benefit from HAF provision.
The maximum estimated budget available for this procurement is £1,190,000
We are looking to award contracts to multiple providers to ensure there is a rich mix of provision that can cater for children of all ages, with different needs and interests, which is spread across the borough to make it easily accessible. The local authority also aims to use the DfE grant to provide the maximum number of places per day that will ensure there is sufficient provision in place for children and their families.
The tender is divided into 3 lots as follows:
Lot 1 - Primary age universal provision (including children with additional needs)
Lot 2 - Secondary age universal provision (including children with additional needs)
Lot 3 - Specialist SEND provision (children of all age groups with significant or complex needs)
SEND Definitions
Additional Needs
Most children with SEN or disabilities will have their needs met in mainstream schools. These children will get support for their individual needs as part of everyday learning, which could be with the whole class or in groups. A SENCO might arrange support from people outside the school to help too.
Significant Needs
Some children have severe learning difficulties. These children will get support which is extra to, or different from, the support given to most of the children in their class.
Complex
A very small number of children have profound or multiple learning difficulties. These children need specialist support, which may come not just from the school but from health and care services too.",-,-,"Building 1000,Dockside Road

The CCGs wish to procure a framework of providers of night sitting services for end of life patients within the localities of the two CCGs.

In September 2021, NICE updated its Quality Standard 13, End of life care for adults. Within this quality standard it advises the following should be in place:
• generalist and specialist services that can meet the physical and specific psychological needs of people approaching the end of life, including access to medicines and equipment, in a safe, effective, and appropriate way at any time of day or night.
• Safe, effective, and appropriate symptom and side-effect management at any time of day or night may require coordinated input from a few different professionals and services. As a minimum, essential 24/7 care services should include:
• generalist medical services (including GPs)
• nursing services (defined as visiting, rapid response services and provision of one-to-one care at home, including overnight)
• personal care services
• access to pharmacy services
• access to equipment and adaptations
• specialist palliative care advice for generalists on symptom and side-effect management.

The North West Model for Life Limiting Conditions covers the breadth of end of life care from stable progressive life-limiting condition; incurable, symptoms treatable all the way through to bereavement care. The requirement of this service provision is to focus on the later stage of element 2 & all stage 3, Advancing Disease & Increasing decline (months and weeks) and last days of life (days and hours).

The Commissioners are planning to support those patients whose preferred place of death is home by means of providing an End of life respite service to enable patients to remain in their usual place of residence whilst receiving 1:1 support. This service will support carers and family members to take breaks from caring for their loved one, whilst knowing they are being care for.

The Framework is for a period of two years (24 months) with an option to extend for 24 months at which time it will be re-opened for new entrants. The estimated financial envelope is £721,590 per annum.",-,-,"Leyland House, Lancashire Business Park

The aim of the service is to address local health inequalities and offer a person-centred approach to help young people thrive on their transition into adulthood.

The service will also have an outreach offer that reaches a wider group of CYP and have robust networks with local schools and colleges.

This service will support young people (ages 13 - 25) who have experienced or may experience a range of life changing events/ trauma, all of which often make the transition to adulthood more complex and mean they can struggle to engage in more formal /clinical settings.

Key service requirements include:
• Quick access to mental health and mental health support in a young person friendly hub and an accessible environment;
• One to one coaching - individual, asset based over a time limited evidence-based model;
• Group Wellbeing activities - needs led, promoting wellbeing and health;
• Schools Sessions - wellbeing awareness, follow up one to one support for those aged 13 - 16;
• Individually tailored support led and owned by young people where they set their own goals and are supported to recognise their strengths and additional support needed;
• Access to wider advice to provide assistance with wider life circumstances impacting mental health e.g., housing, income, bullying, relationships; and
• Collaborative multi-agency working.

The CCG currently has a contract in place with P3 to provide the above services. The contract term expires on 31st March 2022. The CCG is considering options for making future arrangements for these services and is looking to tender the opportunity, for a contract period of 2 years. The contract value is approximately £229,000.00 per annum. The purpose of this PIN is to be transparent about the CCG's intentions and to invite any capable provider interested in delivering the services described above to come forward by 14th April 2022 to engage with the CCG.

If it is the case that P3 is the only provider capable of delivering the services described, then the CCG will look to award a further contract to P3 for up to 2 years from beyond April 2022.

Whilst the CCG considers its procurement options for the service going forward, it may extend its arrangements with the current provider until a new contract is awarded.

During 2022, it is anticipated that NWL CCG will be succeeded by an Integrated Care Board (ICB). Any future contract and/or procurement opportunity may therefore be in the name of the ICB.",-,NWL CCG Contracts Team,"15 Marylebone Road

The Pathogen Surveillance in Agriculture, Food and Environment (PATH-SAFE) programme is a £19.2m Shared Outcomes Fund (SOF) research programme. It aims to develop a national surveillance network, using the latest DNA-sequencing technology and environmental sampling to improve the detection, and tracking of foodborne human pathogens and AMR through the whole agri-food system from farm-to-fork.   The heart of this 'virtual' network will be a new data platform that will permit the analysis, storage and sharing of pathogen sequence and source data, collected from multiple locations across the UK by diverse government and public organisations (incl. FSA, FSS, DHSC, Defra and others across the devolved administrations).  This single, user-friendly data system will enable rapid identification and tracking of foodborne pathogens and AMR, improving public health, and minimising the economic and environmental impact of outbreaks.

By creating a fully integrated surveillance system, we have the potential to not only collect and 'mine' this data in different ways, but also create efficiencies by additionally testing samples collected for one purpose for foodborne pathogens and by having data that can be readily shared between different partners.  Through this pilot project, we will establish a One Health Approach (taking a systems-based view, integrating human, animal, and environmental health), with the establishment of shared technology platforms and common data standards. This approach will directly contribute to the government's 20-year vision and the AMR National Action Plan1, which has made a major, pan-government commitment to countering the risks associated with AMR.  The government has highlighted that the development of new diagnostics and improved access to and use of surveillance data are key levers to tackle this rapid rise and the associated costs of drug-resistant infections through agriculture, food, and the environment.

The PATHSAFE programme has 4 core workstreams (WS) as detailed below.  This pre-engagement advert relates to Workstream 1.   &apos;Establish a curated, national foodborne disease genomic data platform &apos;",https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/Attachment/397892d5-528a-400b-aa86-4c29f6f4acc0,-,"Foss House, Peasholme Green

People Zones are geographical locations across Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland (LLR) which have been identified through crime, public health and census data - (boundary maps for all locations can be found in appendix A).

People Zones aim to provide communities with an opportunity to shape and become involved in work designed to build stronger, safer and more resilient communities.

The main aims of the People Zones are:

Local people and residents feel safer in their communities

People Zone areas are cohesive communities where local people and residents are more resilient and less reliant on services

There are significant reductions in anti-social behaviour and crime within the local area

Currently, there are three People Zones within LLR:

New Parks (City)

Bell Foundry (Charnwood)

Thringstone & Whitwick (North West Leicestershire).

The Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) is passionate about 'relaunching' People Zones following the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on communities, and recognises the importance of adopting a co-production approach. To ensure that People Zones are as relevant, responsive and effective as possible, the OPCC is seeking to widen the involvement of communities and partners in the identification of local strengths, assets and issues within their local area.

To inform the direction of this work, the OPCC is looking to commission one provider to undertake community consultation and research into the People Zone areas by adopting an Asset Based Community Development (ABCD) approach, focusing on people and place assets within the communities. We would expect the successful provider to consult with community members, residents, key stakeholders and community-based organisations to identify, connect and mobilise assets within the People Zones.",https://uk.eu-supply.com/app/rfq/rwlentrance_s.asp?PID=44789&B=BLUELIGHT,Charlotte Highcock,"Police Headquarters, St. Johns, Enderby

As a result, the City has seen its population increase over the last decade, and with it, the need for additional school places.

The number of children seeking a year seven place in Worcester has been consistently increasing over the last decade. Despite expansions at four out of the five existing secondary schools in the City, in Autumn 2020 there were fewer than 10 spare places in year seven across the City. The population of Worcester continues to grow, with increasing cohort numbers due to enter year seven over the next six years, and significant housing developments planned for the City and surrounding area as part of the South Worcestershire Development Plan.

The growth of housing will be particularly focused on the South and South East, which is supported by two secondary schools: Nunnery Wood High and Blessed Edward Oldcorne Catholic. The rise in population in this region is expected to continue with significant housing developments approved on the South Worcester Urban Expansion. Provision in the South is currently below the forecast need for the next five years, with demand approximately four forms of entry (120 places) higher than these two secondary schools can currently support.

As a result, we see fewer young people being offered a place at their preferred secondary school, and more pupils needing to travel across the City for their education. Therefore, the delivery of a new secondary school for the City was agreed at Cabinet in February 2021, and this specification endorsed for Consultation in October 2021.

The location of the proposed school will enable more pupils within the East and North East of the City to access a secondary school within their local community, whom at present are least likely to receive an offer of their preferred secondary school. It will also release pressure on demand for school places elsewhere in the City and enable those schools to support more pupils from proposed new housing.

Under section 6A of the Education and Inspections Act 2006 (the 'free school presumption') where a local authority identifies the need to establish a new school it must, in the first instance, seek proposals to establish an Academy. This specification is designed to guide Academy Trusts in submitting their application to sponsor the new school as outlined in the tender documents and has been informed by engagement with the local community and stakeholders for which it will serve.

The Met Office open ocean buoy network operates in the north Atlantic delivering regular meteorological measurements for forecasting and science. The buoys are in depths of 650m to 4500m and, as standard, report measurements every hour.
The world's oceans hold a vast amount of energy in the form of heat. Measuring temperature profiles at our moored buoy locations will increase our understanding of the current state of the ocean, leading to better ocean and weather forecasts, particularly in the region around the UK.

The profiles will also help to quantify and understand longer term changes in our oceans and climate. We would like to investigate methods of taking as many temperature measurements from the water column at each of our sites as possible and report them back in regular messages. Temperature measurements must be accompanied by pressure (depth) measurements. Instrumentation can be incorporated into our existing mooring or on a separate mooring.

Our existing surface buoy can accommodate subsea communications equipment and can relay data via existing channels. We have 7 deep waters mooring which we wish to gather data on and visit each moored buoy every other year. We aim to service 3 per year, with one site serviced annually.

These providers may re-bid for the modalities that they failed, or add or remove modalities in their submission at Refresh. b) Providers that were successful in the initial procurement process to bid for additional modalities; c) Providers that did not bid in initial procurement process to now bid. New FAs awarded shall be for the remaining length of original Term only); When awarding contracts pursuant to the framework it will be for CAs to determine which modalities or sub-modalities they wish to purchase based on local need and award will be permitted on the basis of either criteria set out in the FA or further competition among those on the Framework.

Energy efficiency and functionality are key principles, and the Project will use a wide range of energy efficient, generation and storage/distribution solutions to support a move to an electric powered operational fleet whilst reducing the site carbon footprint. This procurement opportunity relates specifically to Block F Vehicle Maintenance Workshop Refurbishment and North Tyneside Council will act as Principal Contractor for the project, therefore tenderers should note that they will be working in the capacity of Sub-Contractor. Tenderers must be aware that this is an operational building and as such works must be undertaken taking into consideration the ongoing workshop operations which will require work phasing and innovative delivery solutions to ensure disruption to the service is kept to a minimum. We expect tenderers to liaise closely with the service and out of hours and weekend working will at times be necessary. The Block F site is very restrictive for access / plant movements and therefore it is strongly recommended that Tenderers undertake a site visit, contact details to make arrangements are contained within the Preambles document in the tender pack. This package is anticipated to be completed in 6 weeks the full programme is expected to be delivered between 31 March 2022 and 31 October 2022, this package is expected to be delivered in May 2022.",-,Paul Batey,"Quadrant, Cobalt Business Park

It is one of the largest and best-equipped research and development facilities in Europe for zero-carbon energy, hydrogen, bioenergy, CCUS and combustion. Low-carbon, sustainable energy (heat/power) generation is a key priority for the UK and internationally, with significant global opportunities for technology development and commercialisation. The centre has a range of novel pilot scale technologies and is continuously evolving to meet industrial research requirements. Often there is a need to design and manufacture proptypes, jigs, parts and tools quickly and effectively in order to react to the needs of the research programme. Therefore, the operational team is exploring the use of 3D printing technologies to support these activities.

The TERC operational team has explored a range of 3D printing technologies and whilst metal based printers offer high performance, the complexity of design, print time, build restriction and multiphased manufacture process mean that this technology is not considered suitable for the required application. Furthermore, manufactured parts will need to endure reasonably high temperatures and possess reasonably high strength properties, so base level plastic printing methods are not considered adequate. Therefore, the operational team is looking to procure a composite based 3D printing system, capable of providing the desired flexibility as well as strength, accuracy and size of the application summarised in the technical specification.

We are looking for an external party to map out how achieving the WWF Basket Outcomes will support the delivery of participating retailers Scope 3 emissions reductions.
Critical to the success of a proposal will be a demonstrated ability to understand climate data and trade-offs in a retailer's supply chains. We are also looking for an organisation who can clearly explain and visualise the report the produce.


Outputs, timing and budget
• Delivery of a report (approx. 20-30 pages estimated) which includes:
o Review the ambitions of the WWF Basket
o Produce a report, targeted at WWF & our partner supermarket, based on available science, which details the impact of each area of the WWF Basket on progressing against our partner supermarkets Scope 3 emissions reductions by 2030.
 E.g. achieving a 50/50 protein balance would result in a XX tonnes reduction
 We expect there may be trade-offs involved - for example 'Better Meat' may increase the footprint.
o Include graphs which visualise these pathways
o Provide any relevant commentary and conclusions.
• The available budget for delivery of this work is ~£20-30k. including VAT.

The term of the Framework is 4 years and is planned to commence on 01 July 2022.

It is anticipated that CCGs will merge into Lancashire & South Cumbria Integrated Commissioning Board (ICB), part of the proposed Lancashire & South Cumbria Integrated Care Systems (ICS). It is anticipated this contract will novate to the ICB when it is formed.

Fylde Coast CCGs are looking to redesign respiratory services locally and develop a truly integrated respiratory team capable of delivering ""joined up care at the right time in the optimal setting"" as set out in the NHS Long-Term plan. The ambition is that the AIRS will incorporate a multidisciplinary approach that has a strong focus on care based in the community, with in-reach into the acute setting facilitating earlier discharge and supporting admission/readmission avoidance.

Fylde Coast CCGs are initially seeking to commission an integrated combined Home Oxygen Service-Assessment and Review (HOS-AR) and Pulmonary Rehabilitation Service that will form the foundation of AIRS. The service will align with the vision of the Fylde Coast Respiratory Transformation Programme and develop into a fully integrated, multi-disciplinary, Adult Integrated Respiratory Service, over a three-year timeframe. The delivery model will focus on prevention, identification and early intervention and on-going management, which for the Fylde Coast population will aim to:

• Reduce their risk of developing respiratory disease
• Ensure equitable access to early and accurate diagnosis of respiratory diseases, with early intervention to improve quality of life and slow disease progression.
• Provide high quality, consistent and integrated care for those living with respiratory diseases, with treatments and support provided in a community setting wherever possible.

The service, which will also deliver support for patients who have been diagnosed with post-Covid syndrome, will integrate with existing services e.g. Rapid Response, Respiratory Virtual Ward, to ensure that patients are managed on the most appropriate treatment pathway and that they experience a seamless transition of care.

Potential suppliers should be aware that clarifications to the tender documents should be submitted by 12pm on Thursday 31st March 2022 and tender responses should be submitted before 12pm on Friday 8th April 2022.

This includes those who assisted the UK's efforts in Afghanistan and stood up for values such democracy, women's rights and freedom of speech, rule of law; and vulnerable people, including women and girls at risk and members of minority groups at risk.

We are seeking a supporting organisation, or group of organisations, to help provide necessary temporary support and assistance to families who have arrived in the UK and are accommodated temporarily in a hotel in the local authority area to help them to adjust to life in the UK, until a transfer to permanent housing and the care of another local authority is found.

Support should be provided in a way that empowers individuals into independence, to build their skills and access services independently and deal with everyday issues themselves. This will involve both some on-site presence, coordinated by the provider even where other statutory and voluntary organisations are involved, but consideration should also be given to how families can be supported remotely. It is proposed to procure a single provider, or consortium of providers, to deliver services across all Hampshire Afghan hotels over a 12 month period.

We welcome approaches from organisations who may be interested in working alongside Local Authority staff to support families through:
• Providing meet and great services for new families, and regular onside support within the hotels
• Supporting families to be ready to move into longer-term accommodation
• Support families and other organisations supporting them to access appropriate translation arrangements
• Support residents to access local transport themselves
• Support Health and Social Care colleagues to enable families to be referred to, and access services, and share the latest Covid-19 advice and support
• Support families in accessing documentation and key services, such as Biometric Residency Passes, National Insurance numbers and setting up bank accounts
• Support families to access offers of donations

DO NOT apply directly to the buyer.

All tender information MUST be submitted through the Delta eSourcing Portal.

BEIS places significance importance on having high quality monitoring and evaluation (M&E) activity across the Department. BEIS has created a M&E hub to oversee and support M&E across BEIS alongside a number of M&E experts/teams that are embedded alongside policy teams. BEIS's M&E Framework outlines BEIS' vision for comprehensive, proportionate, good quality monitoring and evaluation across the department and its partner organisations. The aims of this contract contribute to the delivery of that vision.

To support the work of the M&E hub, it is necessary for teams across BEIS to have access to specialist M&E expertise at various points in the project lifecycle. This detailed support is beyond the resources of the M&E Hub itself.

The M&E Hub have identified that the best solution for this is for the M&E hub to commission, and own, a call-off contract which BEIS teams can access. This would allow BEIS teams to efficiently commission expert support without needing to go through an external commissioning process, while also ensuring that they are supported in this area by working with a contractor who has expertise in delivering these tasks. This contract is not intended to replace the stand-alone commissioning of contracts to deliver policy evaluations.

Please ensure you review all attached information to ensure a full understanding of this requirement. All attachments can be found with the Document Uploads tab within the Delta eSourcing Portal.

This contract will be awarded based on the evaluation criteria as set out in the RFP document.

The Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) will be using the Delta eSourcing Portal for this procurement.

The Service shall provide housing-related and parenting support to families who may be at risk of homelessness, with the overall aim of developing essential living skills, resilience and increasing independence.

The Council currently has three contracts in place for the provision of tenancy-related support for families. A decision has been made to tender for a new, comprehensive service which will bring all commissioned family support provision together under one contract with a single provider.

Portsmouth City Council requires a range of accommodation-based and dispersed floating support services to meet the needs of vulnerable families in the city who may be homeless, threatened with homelessness or in significant need of accommodation with additional support. The service will comprise of;
o Element 1: Accommodation-based support for families with significant support needs (minimum 45 units)
o Element 2: Dispersed tenancy support for families living in Local Authority sublet tenancies (minimum 32 units)
o Element 3: Floating family support for families in other housing tenures (minimum 14 units)

An organisation wishing to bid for this contract will need to be able to evidence it can provide accommodation which meets the requirements of element 1 of the Service and the provision of accommodation-based support. Portsmouth Churches Housing Association currently provides 24 units of accommodation across two locations in the city for use as family supported housing under the existing service arrangements. These units are available for use under this new contract should providers wish to use them. Portsmouth City Council will provide local authority housing stock for use by the provider to accommodate families with supported sublet tenancies.

This contract is being tendered under two lots. Tenderers can bid under both lots and indicate a preference.
o Lot 1: 3-year initial term with the provision to extend for 5 further years up to a maximum term of 8 years
o Lot 2: 5-year initial term with the provision to extend for 3 further years up to a maximum term of 8 years
Whilst it is the council's preference to award from lot 1 the council will consider a longer initial term under lot 2 where additional benefits can be realised. The Council reserves the right to award under either lot.

More than half of parents (56%) who used formal childcare before Covid-19 reported that the overall disruption to schools and childcare settings since March 2020 has harmed their child's social and educational development .

Evidence tells us that the quality of education and care in early years has the biggest impact on children's outcomes within a childcare setting. As such, we have designed a recovery programme for early years focused on supporting practitioners and leaders, who are key to addressing the impact of the pandemic on the youngest children.

One of the ways the Department for Education (DfE) is supporting early years settings is through a targeted continuous professional development (CPD) offer and focus on high quality qualifications. As part of this, DfE is conducting a review of the Level 3 qualification, including the criteria.

The Early Years Educator (EYE) Level 3 criteria are the criteria reflected in L3 EY qualifications. If the DfE assesses that a qualification meets the L3 criteria, then it can be considered ""full and relevant"" and added to the Early Years Qualifications List (EYQL) - meaning that holders of this qualification can count as qualified members of staff, and can work within the Level 3 staff:child ratios in England.

This project as a whole seeks to improve the quality and rigour of the L3 early years qualification, including the criteria, through consultation and engagement with stakeholders and users, and rigorous analysis of new and available data, thereby strengthening its quality and evidence-base. Our intention is for the review to take into account both the L3 criteria and its delivery. This Invitation to Tender (ITT) is for the first part of the project - the review itself. The review will be conducted by an organisation or consortium selected by DfE. This contract will run from WC 23 May 2022 to COP Friday 9 September 2022. There will be subsequent stages of the project after the review.",https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education/about/procurement#jaggaer-the-dfe-etendering-portal,-,"Cumberland Place

The University operates an MC40 Cyclotron and a neutron beam facility is currently being built. The MC40 Cyclotron can produce the proton beam energies in the range of 3~38 MeV. The proposed system will be integrated to the Cyclotron and/or the neutron beams for mechanical testing under elevated temperatures, with in-situ irradiation.

The system needs to be interface with the irradiation beams at the University of Birmingham. Thus, it is expected that the system should be mobile and/or adjustable in terms of the positioning.

The system shall be able to operate under different environmental conditions, such as air, vacuum or gaseous.

The system shall enable the testing of flat samples, but the capability of testing samples of other geometries (such as cylindrical) is highly desirable.

The system shall be able to accurately measure and control the temperate of the testing sample. The maximum testing sample temperature equal to, or greater than, 1200 oC is needed. The capability of testing at temperatures lower than the ambient temperature is a plus.

The system shall be able to accurately measure and control the displacement/strain on the testing sample. The capability of remote strain measurement such as digital image correlation is highly desirable.

The system shall be able to provide the maximum load of 5 kN or above. It is highly desirable to have exchangeable load-cells with different maximum loads. The system shall have a digital control system to deliver custom deformation waveforms (e.g. static loading, creep, fatigue including TMF etc), as well as cooled (using liquid nitrogen/water) grips for temperature control (essential for samples subjected to high beam currents).",-,Susanna Ting,"University of Birmingham

The number of operational buildings is expected to reduce as the Council's estate rationalisation programme progresses. The Council has a mix of electricity (half hourly and non-half hourly) and gas meters for its sites and infrastructure.

The Council seeks to procure flexible supply contracts for 2 lots - Lot 1 Electricity and Lot 2 Gas and via an Open procedure procurement exercise. Each Lot will be awarded to a single supplier for the contract duration. Each contract will be for an initial term of 3 years (commencing 1st October 2022), with an option to extend for up to a further 3 years, at the Council's discretion.

Bidders must be Ofgem licensed energy suppliers, and are required to offer a flexible supply contract, which encompasses the ability to forward purchase the commodity element via a trading desk using OTC (Over the counter) after the contract has been completed. In addition, bidders for Lot 1 Electricity must: (i) be able to provide sleeving arrangements under which any renewable electricity sourced from off-site renewable generators can potentially be included at an additional cost in the electricity supply contract should the Council choose to do so at a later date; and (ii) provide REGO (Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin) backed renewable energy across the electricity portfolio.

Due to current market volatility, the Council will require Bidders to submit indicative Swing/Shape fees in their pricing schedules. This rate will not form part of the evaluation. Final rates will be agreed with the successful Bidder(s), using their submitted indicative rate as a benchmark.

Bidders must note that, due to the Council's ongoing estate rationalisation plans, consumption across both Lots is likely to decrease over the life of the contracts.

Annual consumption figures are:

Electricity (NHH and HH):
Number of sites: 317 // Total Annual Consumption: 39,495,720 kWh

Gas:
Number of sites: 114 // Total Annual Consumption: 17,198,184 kWh

Bidders must also note that is the Lots are for energy supply contracts only. The Council's bureau and trade desk services are contracted to a third party provider. Therefore, the Council will, from time to time, use its authorised third party provider to manage the supply contracts including, but not limited to, purchases of electricity and gas.",-,Natasha I-Goldsmith,"County Hall

Request for Information (RFI)

The Commissioner is seeking the views of Healthcare Providers in relation to the provision of a Primary Care Service for the Homeless in Brighton and Hove. The Commissioner is considering a contract period of five (5) years with an option to extend for a further period of up to two (2) years (5+2).
This is a process designed to help the Commissioner to form a view of the best way to commission the service and is not the beginning of a Tender exercise. A Tender advertisement may be issued at the appropriate time, if required, should the Commissioner consider that the optimum route to commission the service is through a procurement exercise. Some questions may seem more relevant and easier to respond to than others at the moment. Please try to respond to as many as you can, as your views are valuable whether or not you have previously come across all of the aspects covered.

Significant progress has been made nationally to improve health outcomes for the population however; health inequalities remain for many socially excluded groups. Health inequalities amongst the homeless population are evidenced at both a National and Local Level, with evidence of significantly lower life expectancy and poorer health outcomes amongst the homeless. Those who find themselves homeless are often extremely vulnerable with complex health and care needs and high levels of comorbidity including: physical, mental health and substance misuse needs. They may be excluded from services or have difficulty engaging with mainstream services, relying instead on emergency or urgent care services such as: Accident & Emergency.

Provision of a Primary Care Service for the Homeless aims to achieve the following:
Aims and objectives of the service
• Improved identification of homeless patients in primary care and acute services
• Increased utilisation of planned health care
• Reduction in the inappropriate use of secondary care
• Delivery of effective preventative health services
• Provision of safe environments that promote physical and psychological well being
• Facilitation of service users to take increasing responsibility for their own health and well being
• Integration of care delivery across health, social care and homeless services through strongly managed co-ordination of services and partnership working
• Delivery of personalised services
• Support for people to access and maintain suitable accommodation, linking with existing local services as appropriate

Please complete your response via our eTendering Portal, reference: Primary Care Services for the Homeless NHS/SOEPS/21.820/RFI by 5pm on Tuesday 5th April 2022.

The works are located on the Hoo Peninsular. The Hoo peninsula is situated in Kent to the east of Gravesend and to the north of Chatham. As part of a Housing Infrastructure Funding Grant, Medway Council are upgrading the current freight only railway.

The existing Network Rail line through the Hoo Peninsula is called the Grain Branch line which connects the North Kent Line at Hoo Junction to the Isle of Grain. The line was closed to passenger services in 1968 and is now a freight only railway, with no stations remaining. The 19km long line is a single, bi-directional line serving freight trains that use the Isle of Grain docks (Thamesport) and Cliffe sidings. The existing line will require enhancements to enable the required passenger services to operate while maintaining freight services.

The new rail service will enable passengers to travel from a new station near Sharnal Street to the main line and on to London via connecting services to London Charing Cross, London Victoria, London Bridge, and London St Pancras International.

Situated between Southbourne and Hengistbury Head, Bistro on the Beach (BH6 4BE), has traded successfully for the past 15 years, proving to be a popular restaurant for both residents and visitors alike. It finally closed its doors in October 2021 to enable the site to be redeveloped

The slab will be constructed of a levelled concrete screed with hoarding attached for edge protection. The Council will erect temporary public toilets and a bin store at the eastern edge of the slab, adjacent to the existing beach huts

The Council is seeking bids from suppliers with a proven track record in the hospitality service area to create a modern beach pop up restaurant to animate the beach and create a place to meet, work, eat, drink, have fun, be inspired and ultimately enjoy the view at Southbourne Beach.

The supplier will gain access to the site to commence their build from Monday 23 May 2022. Should the site become available earlier, this will be communicated to the supplier.

In 2018, SCCL (the management function of the NHS Supply Chain) entered contracts with 11 Category Tower Service Providers (CTSPs) to provide goods and services to NHS trusts and healthcare organisations across England and Wales. Goods are delivered through two enabling services which underpin the CTSP model, these enabling services are Logistics and Fulfilment, and Supporting Technology.

The scope of the current contract involves the operational logistics management of the NHS Supply Chain estate, Home Delivery Services (HDS), additional in-bound logistics and inter-depot trunking services.

NHS Supply Chain currently manages more than 8 million orders per year, across 94,000 order points and 17,465 locations and delivers over 28 million lines of picked goods to the NHS annually. Its systems consolidate orders from over 930 suppliers, saving trusts time and money by removing duplication of overlapping contracts.

The above scope may be further extended to incorporate the provision of pandemic response logistics, this may include the storage and fulfilment of legacy Covid 19 related consumables and equipment.

SCCL would like to meet with Potential Providers who are advised to register on the jaggaer system under Project 979 at https://nhssupplychain.app.jaggaer.com/ for further important information about the Market Engagement Sessions pre-market engagement questionnaire.

Many centres in the British Council Network offer Young Learner holiday courses on top of their regular academic year programmes. These courses take place at different times during the year.
An initial internal piece of research conducted in late 2018 obtained responses from 26 centres across EA, EU, MENA & South Asia. This research highlighted that these courses are planned locally and vary in length, structure & content.
Pre-Covid there were signs that the market for holiday courses was growing & competition from direct & indirect competitors was increasing during holiday periods.

The maximum annual budget is £396,089. The service commencement date is 1st October 2022 for a term of 3 years plus the option to extend for a further 24 months.

The aim of this Transition Service is to provide young people moving from Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS), with a mental health support provision to other services (including primary care) to meet the needs of young service users before they may qualify for Adult Mental Health support provisions.

As per the Service Specification, this Transitions Service has been given its name based on the transition from Children and Adolescence to Adults Mental Health and Support provisions.

The point of transition from child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) is recognised as a point of potential upheaval for young people who may find it difficult to navigate new service settings, or to manage their mental health following discharge from CAMHS, especially as the availability and offer of support can change dramatically from CAMHS to Adult Mental Health Services (AMHS) or voluntary sector services.
The transition out of CAMHS must be supported by a robust and coordinated multi-agency approach to transition planning. This process is further strengthened by early and effective planning, which may start as young as 15 or as late as 25 and putting the young person at the centre of the process to help them prepare. The process, in many ways a preparation for adulthood, will need to support young people to be as independent as possible. Despite this, services often remain poorly coordinated, and it is vulnerable service users and their families who are left to suffer.

The value within this Notice is a maximum limit which is inclusive of all options. £1980,445.00

High productivity dairy animals are often poorly suited to beef production, and dairy/beef cross breeding increases the opportunity for calves to enter the value chain. At present it is estimated that around half of all UK beef is sourced via this route. Specialist beef production relies on dedicated suckler beef breeds, with limited capability for economically viable milk production.

This study will explore the role of breeds, such as heritage and dual-purpose cattle, that currently contribute a smaller amount to overall production. These breeds are generally used in heritage enterprises as well as for conservation grazing. The products from these cattle can either go into the general production chain or are sold separately as market differentiated products at an increased price. There is potential however for this share to be expanded beyond specialist systems and in addition these animals hold potentially valuable genetic material which can be used to improve the overall stock within the UK.

Aim of the research
An evidence review is required to assess the potential for heritage and dual-purpose cattle breeds to provide either a larger share of the current dairy and beef production, or to use for crossbreeding aiming for certain traits to improve efficiency, animal health and reduce GHG emissions. This review would aim to identify the efficiency and suitability of different breeds to beef and/or dairy production and which ones hold potential for future breeding. Whilst accounting for a variety of conditions such as differences in diet, land management (e.g., conservation grazing, marginal grazing), climate and general management.",https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/Attachment/1dc496cc-07cf-468e-8d5c-09c67a384590,Defra,"17 Nobel House

This paper seeks to do the following:
Part 1 - Make the case for nature in climate transition plans
• Build out the economic and financial narrative on why nature goals should be included in transition plans. Demonstrate that to achieve Net Zero Goals, we need to reverse nature loss, and that incorporating nature goals will help companies and financial institutions to achieve their net zero goals.
• Produce a small number of illustrative case studies (1-3) comparing how the transition might look if nature goals are or are not included, in order to demonstrate why their inclusion will generate better economic, financial and environmental outcomes, and their exclusion would result in unintended impacts on nature, and undermine commitments on nature. This should start with the food and agricultural sectors.

Part 2 - Examine how this might be done: develop recommendations as to how nature goals might best be incorporated into transition plans. This might include the following:
• Explore and compare the likely international frameworks (e.g., those of the ISSB and TCFD) and metrics that may be used as the foundation of transition plans, to comment on the extent to which they cover nature-positive objectives.
• Identify how companies are incorporating nature alongside net zero goals into their business decision-making frameworks already, to inform thinking about how these approaches might be incorporated into transition plan frameworks.

However, as outlined in the Group's 2030 vision (Appendix G), there is a need to be adequately prepared for further change and upcoming challenges in the HE sectors.

Operating within the competitive higher and further education markets means that Coventry University must invest in, and rethink, its digital experience to meet the expectations of both the current and future student needs. The role of technology, and the way it is used, at universities and colleges is increasingly seen as a strategic differentiator.

The rise of ""Digital"" and the growing importance of student satisfaction to the overall performance of HE institutions creates an imperative for institutions to ensure that the processes, systems, and functions involved in formulating the student user experience and customer service delivery are future ready across Coventry University.

To maximise this opportunity, Coventry University is taking a holistic view of the student journey, from application through to alumni. As we enhance and optimise the end-to-end student journey through the Student Engagement Programme (SEP), we need to ensure that the equivalent learning experience enables all our teaching & learning platforms to work collectively in the form of a distinctive Coventry University EdTech ecosystem. Therefore, this approach enables us to reimagine the entire student experience through a new, forward-looking programme, bringing new platforms and partnerships which places student engagement and attainment at the centre of this work.

Coventry is a global university with offices in China, Kenya, Nigeria, and Pakistan it has world leading research and academic partners on every continent, with students gaining life changing experiences all over the world.

This document outlines the tender requirements identified for a Coventry University-wide Online Assessment platform, offering a digitally enabled, student-centred and accessible curriculum.

LQHT has over 1000 distinct estates across England, grouped by lots and regions. Grounds Maintenance contracts and Tree Maintenance contracts have been awarded to specialist Contractor Companies for each lot. This means several different Contractor Companies are responsible for fulfilling maintenance contracts across LQHT's properties.

The scope of Grounds Maintenance covers the maintenance of all communal, soft, and hard landscape surfaces. This will include all communal areas, play areas, verges, gardens (and roof gardens where applicable), wooded areas, non-adopted roads, and pathways/walkways (including covered walkways).

The scope of Tree Maintenance covers the periodic inspection of LQHT's approx. 20000 trees and the completion of remediation work identified during these inspections.

The Solution required will:

- integrate with GIS and property data owned by LQHT, allowing LQHT and Contractor Companies to identify trees and grounds requiring maintenance work and maintain up to date physical asset data
- allow LQHT to create Work Items and Schedules of Work
- maintain reference data describing Work Types and Work Categories so Work Items can be assigned to the correct Contractor Company and budget
- manage individual workflows between LQHT and Contractor Companies
- allow Work Items to be completed and evidenced with uploaded photographs
- perform service charge calculations and allocation based on reference data
- allow LQHT to raise issue notices with Contractor Companies and manage the workflow to complete these

The Supplies will help LQHT achieve several elements of LQHT's corporate plan including 'creating quality homes and estates that our customers can be proud of through a new approach to property maintenance', 'reducing operational costs and promoting efficiencies which ultimately improves resident experience', and 'achieving a minimum of 80% customer satisfaction in the look and feel of our estates'.

1.8 LQHT have developed an Interim Solution that will support Grounds Maintenance and Tree Maintenance contracts until the Supplies go live. There is no requirement for the Solution to integrate with the Interim Solution. There is no requirement for historic Work Items to be migrated from the Interim Solution into the Solution.

1.9 LQHT require the Supplier to adhere at all times to the LQHT Supplier Code of Conduct and sign up to the LQHT Expected Standards of Behaviours of LQHT Suppliers as listed in Appendix 10 and as available via the Procurement Portal. Note the LQHT Expected Standards of Behaviours of LQHT Suppliers document is included in the Section 7 Checklist.

The Enhanced Frailty Service thus aims to provide a wrap-around service for frail venerable patients, with General Practice (GPs) at the heart of the service model, supported through a multi-disciplinary team of professionals. A patient's registered GP will provide the central service offer and will draw upon the wider expertise within primary care and the wider community and acute services.

The service will be achieved through the delivery of a three-tiered approach:
• Tier 1 - core General Practice services are at the heart of our health care system and are the first point of contact for patients. A patient's registered GP will provide the central and core service offer for the management of frail patients. This service is provided through a GP's Core Contract.
• Tier 2 - comprises of both a proactive and reactive arm. Patients will escalate to an enhanced primary care service at tier 2 by their GP as their needs become more complex and require greater coordination. The PCN frailty workforce are central to this second-tier response, providing enhanced and specialist care to the PCN frail population.
• Tier 3 - component of the service is a Primary Care led multidisciplinary team (blended and adaptable depending on patients need). The multi-disciplinary teams will provide care for the most complex of the patient cohort groups, ensuring continuity and care longevity. The tier 3 service element will be overseen by the PCN frailty lead with ready access to patient registered GP and with access to the wider MDT for support to the most complex of patients.
The service will provide holistic care by carrying out comprehensive geriatrician assessment; identification of escalating needs; personalised medication review; connection to resources in the community; care Coordination; Multi-agency input (MDT); and intervention to avoid deterioration and hospital conveyance.

We are looking to run a procurement exercise in early April 2022 with the intention of a new contract starting 1st July 2022 for a contract period of 3 years + 1 + 1. The estimated contract value is £10,000,000.00. The purpose of this PIN is to be transparent about the CCG's intentions and to invite any capable provider interested in delivering the services described above to come forward by 4th April 2022 to engage with the CCG.

During 2022, it is anticipated that NWL CCG will be succeeded by an Integrated Care Board (ICB). Any future contract and/or procurement opportunity may therefore be in the name of the ICB.",-,NWL CCG Contracts Team,"15 Marylebone Road

The aim of the service is to deliver support for people affected by domestic abuse. The service will be comprehensive, evidence based, accessible, respect client confidentiality, high quality, responsive to client needs and cost-effective. Service delivered will support those affected by domestic abuse by offering accommodation services as well as a community based and advocacy service. There are 2 women's refuges in Havering and it is proposed to offer this accommodation to incoming providers. Addresses for the women's refuges will remain confidential.

The local authority wishes to introduce a single contract that will encourage bidders to secure efficiencies when developing an innovative service that delivers care and support to people affected by domestic abuse. There is an interim contract in place until the 31.8.2022 and it is anticipated that a new service will start on the 1.9. 2022. London Borough of Havering is committed to providing high quality services for its clients and the provision of 2 accommodation based refuges and a community based service is highly valued by the local community.

- Domestic Abuse & Sexual Offences in London: Domestic Abuse represents one in every ten recorded crimes in London. There were 94,503 flagged domestic abuse offences in 2020/21 and 23,320 domestic abuse violence with injury offences. This accounts for approximately a quarter of all domestic abuse offences. Havering: Data from The Mayor's Office for Policing And Crime (MOPAC) shows domestic abuse activity in Havering increased by 5.7% to 7,795 in 2019-20 then decreased by 3.5% to 7,522 in 2020-21. However, because of covid restrictions it is possible fewer domestic abuse cases were reported and it is likely cases may rise over the coming years.

The dilution refrigerator will be appropriate for cooling a two-component payload, consisting of (i) An electromagnetic resonator, such as a conducting-wall resonant cavity; and (ii) Ultra-low-noise readout electronics in as close proximity as possible to the resonator, allowing them to be coupled together. The space for the electromagnetic resonator should be threaded by a static magnetic field of nominal magnitude 8T, The ultra-low-noise readout electronics should be in a magnetic-field-free region, with magnetic field exclusion achieved via a combination of a field compensation coil and passive normal-conducting and superconducting shields mounted in the bore of the compensation coil. The operating base temperature of the refrigerator should be not more than 10mK at the mixing chamber plate, where the cooling power should be at least 12 microwatts at 20mK and at least 400 microwatts at 100mK. The experiment will run cold and at with the magnetic field threading the cavity for at least 6 months at a time without need to be warmed up. The refrigerator should utilize mechanical pre-cooling to a sufficiently low temperature for the dilution refrigerator to operate, so that the only liquid cryogens that are required are the helium3/helium4 mixture in the closed cycle dilution refrigerator unit and some liquid nitrogen that may be required for a cold trap in the gas handling unit. The system should incorporate its own reliable control system and software for ease of control, and this control system should also be remotely operable from the data acquisition system of the experiment, via an appropriate cable interface. A schedule of tests required to demonstrate function upon delivery of the apparatus are supplied in the technical specification.

This is following on from a successful run of pilot sessions with ECC staff at all levels across all functions.
We would like this training to equip residents with the tools they need to successfully, and crucially safely, intervene in situations that may be uncomfortable or threatening for all residents, and women in particular. The standard route to this appears to be teaching the 4D's technique (Direct, Distraction, Delegation and Delay) for intervention and practicing their application with scenarios in some variation.
• Direct action looks at intervening directly in the moment to call out harmful behaviour and shut it down.
• Distraction is useful in micro-aggression situations to not draw attention to a situation and take the awkwardness out of the room.
• Delegation involves escalating the issue fairly.
• Delay gives you time to think and assess what the best way to intervene is.
Previous engagement with the market has indicated that Bystander Intervention Training is not traditionally offered outside of a workplace, which has led to ECC wanting to engage further. We would be grateful if you could answer some questions (please limit your responses 250 words where possible) and return your answers to Neave Beard, Lead for Strengthening Communities at Essex County Council at Neave.Beard@essex.gov.uk.",https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/Attachment/97a588d4-c197-4505-b711-5c159b2d8250,Neave Beard,"County Hall

1629,HMS Victory Timber Supply Early Market Engagement (PIN),THE NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE ROYAL NAVY,Timber - 03419000,PO1 3NH,-,225557,28 February 2022,1 April 2022,-,-,-,-,-,Yes,No,"Over the next 12 years the National Museum of the Royal Navy (NMRN) are leading the conservation of HMS Victory to ensure the long-term preservation of a world-class historic vessel and an exemplar of a Royal Navy capital warship from the Age of Sail.
In addition to being a unique historic asset, HMS Victory continues to be a significant visitor attraction within Portsmouth Historic Dockyard whilst continuing to serve as a commissioned warship of the Royal Navy.

The aim of the HMS Victory Conservation Programme is to deliver a fully-conserved HMS Victory, in an open environment, and in a condition to survive for the next 50 years without major work beyond a programme of planned maintenance.

The conservation work includes replacement of all external and some internal planking in a staged programme; it is intended that the ship remains open to the public throughout the planned work.

Core to the programme is the procurement of Timber, primarily Oak, to meet the planned Hull Conservation programme. Where solid timber of sufficient size and quality is not available the NMRN will require the supply suitable timber for lamination in NMRN's workshops.

In addition to planking, additional solid 'curved' timber will be needed to replace items such as knees and beams (compass timber), and the timber supplier(s) will be expected to work with the NMRN to source and produce such items.

To achieve this requirement, the NMRN recognise that the procurement model is likely to consist of a 'framework-type' service agreement, separated into Lots associated with the various elements of Timber supply.

The NMRN are seeking a range of suppliers who meet the following:

Flexibility and Responsive to Change
- Suppliers who are flexible in their approach and can cope with changing environments, processes, and requirements.
- Suppliers who can operate seamlessly during the whole duration of the contract.

Compliance
- Suppliers who fully comply with all contractual obligations, national, and international laws.
- Suppliers who fully comply with environmental requirements, as specified by the NMRN.

This notice intends to identify suppliers who would like to express an interest in providing these services and to invite all interested parties to attend a Market Engagement Event.

The purpose of this early market engagement is to:
• secure wider market interest in the supply of Timber, including Timber buyers, sawmills, forestry and suppliers/distributors;
• to assess the level of appetite from different providers in the delivery of such provision; and
• to test with the market the potential delivery and procurement model.

The NMRN plans to hold a 'hybrid' Market Engagement Event both face-to-face at Portsmouth historic Dockyard and via MS Teams, on Tuesday, 12th April 2022 from 10:00 - 15:00.

The Expression of Interest for the Programme is now open. The purpose of this EOI is to raise early awareness of the proposed competition and to gauge the level of interest, enabling BEIS to gain a better understanding of the range of potential applicants. If you may be interested in applying to this competition, please complete the BEIS Industrial Hydrogen Accelerator Programme EOI Form to express interest at tinyurl.com/2fa6h2k4

Programme overview

The Industrial Hydrogen Accelerator (IHA) competition is a proposed innovation funding programme that would support the demonstration of end-to-end industrial fuel switching to hydrogen. It aims to prove the feasibility and reduce the costs and risks of hydrogen fuel switching systems. The scope would include the full technology chain, from hydrogen generation and delivery infrastructure through to industrial end-use, including the integration of the components in a single project.

The projects would develop knowledge on the design and implementation of hydrogen systems for industry to showcase 'first-of-a-kind' blueprints to enable accelerated deployment in the late 2020s and support the UK's 2030 5GW hydrogen production ambition. The funding would aim to catalyse the hydrogen economy through enabling early industrial movers. It would further aim to develop stakeholder knowledge, confidence and awareness. The resulting evidence would be vital to kickstart industrial hydrogen fuel switching deployment, supporting the UK's leading global role in the sector.

The Industrial Hydrogen Accelerator Programme is proposed to form part of BEIS' £1bn Net Zero Innovation Portfolio, announced in the Prime Minister's 10 Point Plan in autumn 2020. This innovation portfolio runs until March 2025 and aims to accelerate the commercialisation of innovative clean energy technologies and processes through the 2020s and 2030s.

The proposed Industrial Hydrogen Accelerator would support projects through providing funding for demonstrators and, where needed, feasibility studies.
• The feasibility studies would explore how systems could be designed and provide information on the technical requirements and costs.
• The demonstration projects would construct end-to-end industrial hydrogen systems, from hydrogen production to end-use, to prove their feasibility and provide further evidence on the real-world performance and costs. The expected scale of demonstrations is likely to be of the order 1-10MW.

The evidence generated by the IHA on the use of hydrogen by industrial users would help inform strategic decisions in 2026 on the role of low carbon hydrogen as a replacement for natural gas in the gas grid.

HMPPS works with partners to carry out the sentences given by the courts, either in custody or the community.

HMPPS reduce reoffending by rehabilitating the people in its care by working with them to address their offending related needs, developing their strengths and enhancing opportunities to access education and employment.

HMPPS delivers the government's vision and investment to make prisons places of safety and reform and ensuring probation services support the rehabilitation of offenders while protecting the public.

Drug testing is a key strategic tool in tackling substance misuse in both custody and the community. The testing of prisoners and people on probation for illicit use of substances are long standing instruments used to measure the prevalence of drug use within the criminal justice system and to help manage risk of harm and reoffending.

The Authority is managing this procurement in accordance with its general obligations under EU law and specifically in accordance with the Open Procedure set out in the Regulations.

This procurement will be in the form of a Lotted Procurement with two Lots. The Lots are as follows:
Lot 1 - the provision of Drug Testing: Laboratory Analysis Products, Services and Prevalence Testing.
Lot 2 - the provision of Drug Testing: Point of Care Testing Equipment and Associated Services.

Bidders are able to submit Tender responses for both Lot 1 and Lot 2 and may be awarded both Lots if they are the successful bidder for both.

Lot 1 requires a single Supplier or entity to provide Laboratory Analysis Products, Services and Prevalence Testing in order to help HMPPS achieve the ability to test individuals for illicit use of substances and measure the prevalence of drug use within the criminal justice system. HMPPS requires a Supplier that is able to offer innovation and continuous improvement, including, but not limited to, exploring the use of wastewater analysis to identify illicit substances throughout the Contract Term.

Lot 2 requires a single Supplier or entity to provide Point of Care Testing (POCT) Equipment and Associated Services in order to help HMPPS achieve the ability to test individuals for illicit use of substances. HMPPS requires a Supplier that is able to offer innovation and continuous improvement throughout the Contract Term.

The description of the Goods and Services required under each Lot is further described in the relevant Specification and procurement documents available on the procurement portal which can be accessed by following the URL address above. For the avoidance of doubt, in respect of Lot 1 in particular, the Authority intends to consider innovative solutions for the testing of drugs and the prevalence of drugs in the criminal justice system during the Contract Term.",https://ministryofjusticecommercial.bravosolution.co.uk/,Stephen Greiff,"1st Floor, 5 Wellington Place

The screening and treatment for a MHTR are commissioned by the Health & Justice team, as part of NHSE/I London's Specialised Commissioning division.

The Service
The provider would screen women who had been referred by either Probation, Defence or Liaison and Diversion who are potentially suitable for a MHTR. If the individual agrees, this will be shared with Probation who will include the recommendation into the Pre Sentence Report for the Judiciary for them to consider whether a MHTR could be part of any sentencing options. Where a woman is given a MHTR as part of a community order the provider would deliver a number of sessions over a specified period, determined by the court and provide psychological treatment/interventions, to address the underlying mental health issues which may be contributing towards the underlying offending issues. The Provider will work directly with probation around support which will increase compliance, as well as proactively support the woman to comply with the MHTR, and therefore reduce breaches. This service would be available to any woman appearing in any of the Magistrates' Courts or Crown Courts in London.

The provider would be expected to work closely with Liaison and Diversion Services across London, as well as the Probation Service, Courts, substance misuse providers and third sector. Where a woman has additional needs, working with the Probation Service, will support her to access appropriate services to support her to address those needs.

Contract Length and value:

The contract for the Service will be awarded for a period of 3 years (36 months), with an optional extension for a further period of 2 years (24 months). Therefore, the maximum duration of this contract, if all extension options are taken up will be 5 years (60 months).

The maximum available annual contract value for this project is £620,000 per annum.
Over the 5 years, if contract is extended to its full duration, the total maximum contract value will be £3,100,000.
The annual payments will be subject to inflationary uplifts in line with published NHS national planning guidance.

This is the markets opportunity to engage with the Authority prior to publication of the planned tender.

Through this Terms of Reference (ToR), the Authority is seeking a Supplier to carry out an assessment of the IWT supply chain from the lens of key countries. A core component of this assessment will be a political, economic, social, technological, legal, and environmental analysis to understand to what extent these factors influence IWT supply chains in each country.
This analysis will provide a supporting evidence base for the development of future UK interventions to counter IWT, based on an accurate picture of the IWT situation in country. This includes building an understanding of transnational supply chains, best practice, opportunities, and priority of interventions.

This analysis will be focused within Cambodia, China, Laos, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, South Africa and Vietnam. These countries have been chosen due to their interaction with known significant IWT supply chains and represent supply, transit and destination countries. These countries represent an interest for the UK in terms of recognising the scale of the issue and impact
on supply chains, building the evidence base to support future engagement, including opportunities to build on existing best practice interventions, and expand on/ complement existing UK programming and engagement.

The analysis will be split into 4 workstreams to be undertaken in each country:

Workstream 1: Provide an overview of the IWT situation in each country, and the role of each country directly or indirectly in global IWT, through supply, transit and/or demand of illegal products. Identify the key geographical linkages through the supply chain and review the evidence relating to trends and scale of IWT.

Workstream 2: Provide a detailed assessment of the political, economic, social, technological, cultural, and environmental factors in country that are driving the illegal wildlife trade and the significance and scale of each factor in facilitating it.
Workstream 3: Identify current interventions within countries, assessing their effectiveness in delivering change (including identifying other donors and their activities), and any gaps in existing approaches.

Workstream 4: Building on Workstream 3, identify gaps in counter IWT interventions and outcomes, including where activities could be enhanced and expanded. Applying lessons learned from Workstream 2, assess these gaps for opportunities for future engagement, including considering: evidence of need; evidence of effectiveness; feasibility and potential constraints; impact on IWT; scalability and sustainability.",https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/Attachment/a0cddfaf-58ed-47ce-8b7f-98d56f5cb796,Andy,"Quadrant 2, 99 Parkway Avenue

*** This is a Prior Information Notice and not a call for competition****
During the global pandemic FSCS further enhanced its smarter working office working environment which included extending collaboration spaces and introducing additional hybrid meeting technology. It has become clear that to effectively manage our office environment we will be required to monitor office occupancy during the short, medium, and long term.

As smarter working patterns evolve, FSCS requires an office design contractor to design and create new workspaces for us.

To achieve this, FSCS is planning to undertake a procurement exercise to appoint up to five (5) contractors to an office design contractor framework that will facilitate appointed firms to bid on future office design specifications created by FSCS.",https://www.delta-esourcing.com/delta/respondToList.html?noticeId=660776373,-,"Beaufort House

The two frameworks in question are the International Multi-Disciplinary Programme (IMDP) and the Global Economic Development Framework (GEDF). The current plan is to combine them into a single framework with multiple thematic Lots - the International Multi-Disciplinary Framework (IMDF). The procurement is planned to commence in the coming months and we are seeking feedback on our planned approach.

The new framework will be in place by early 2023 and will include suppliers who are able to meet the requirements of a wide variety of Programme thematics and objectives.

This notice is being published to advertise a forthcoming market engagement exercise. The market engagement event (or a series of engagement events) will be held during March 2022.

The market engagement exercise is open to all persons who are interested (or may be interested) in being part of the replacement for the IMDP & GEDF frameworks, and their supply chains. This includes existing market operators, potential new entrants and persons who may be interested in participating jointly through membership of a joint venture or consortium.

The framework will be re-procured via the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office&apos;s e-procurement portal: https://fcdo.bravosolution.co.uk. Suppliers, not currently registered on the portal, who are interested in being considered for this Framework Agreement must self-register on the site in order to participate - registration is free and instantaneous. Suppliers already registered on FCDO/Jaggaer will not need to re-register, but will need to complete the full suite of tender documents once issued to be considered for the new procurement framework.

The contracting authority will consider the feedback received to help inform its options and further decision making. For the avoidance of doubt, this phase of the project is not part of a formal procurement process and the contracting authority is not committing, at this stage, to carrying out such a process.

Participation or non-participation in this market engagement exercise shall not prevent any supplier participating in a potential future procurement, nor is it intended that any information supplied as part of this exercise shall place any supplier at an advantage in a potential procurement process.

Suppliers wishing to attend the forthcoming market engagement events should register their interest by completing the registration form (https://bit.ly/3uOW37i).

Associated OJEU Contract Notice publication number: 2018/S 037-080867.


Innovate UK is establishing a Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS) as a means of awarding contracts for monitoring services.

Innovate UK provides grant funding to individuals and organisations involved in developing technology and science innovations. It is vital for Innovate UK that the performance and progress of publicly funded projects are monitored to ensure that the funding is used properly and effectively.

The DPS is divided into a 48 Lots based on the different areas of innovation to which the innovation projects relate.

The DPS is a completely electronic tendering system through which Monitoring Services Providers (MSPs) can apply to be admitted to a specific Lot. Interested parties must specify which Lots they are applying to join. Admission to a Lot or Lots is no guarantee of work, but Innovate UK's intention would be to invite tenders from MSPs within Lots for future Monitoring Services opportunities.

The DPS will remain open and valid from the start date of 23rd February 2018 for an initial period of two years, with the option to extend the operation of the DPS for two further 12 month periods.

See attached documents for DPS Overview and DPS Rules.

MSPs can apply to join the DPS at any time in the life of the DPS by completing the registration details at https//innovateuk.force.com/s/registration-page .


About Innovate UK and UKRI.

Innovate UK is the UK's innovation agency. We are
an executive non-departmental public body sponsored
by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial
Strategy (BEIS) and are incorporated as the
Technology Strategy Board by Royal Charter in
England and Wales.
In April 2018 changes will be made to the structure of
the UK's research and innovation bodies (including
Innovate UK). A new body corporate will be
established under the Higher Education and Research
Act 2017 that brings together the UK's seven
Research Councils, Innovate UK and a new
organisation, Research England. This new body will
be known as UK Research and Innovation (""UKRI"").
With the establishment of UKRI, Innovate UK
(Technology Strategy Board) will cease to exist as a
body corporate in its own right and will become a
committee or 'Council' of UKRI. Innovate UK will
continue to administer contract and grant funding and
to manage the relationship with MSPs as a Council of
UKRI. However, existing contracts awarded by
Innovate UK under the DPS will be transferred to
UKRI under a statutory transfer scheme and future
contracts awarded under the DPS will be entered into
by UKRI. More information about UKRI is available

This package will focus on supporting refugees to become self-sufficient and integrate into society. The policy statement says:

We will continue to encourage asylum via safe and legal routes, strengthening our support by offering an enhanced integration package to those arriving in this manner and immediate indefinite leave to remain in the UK for resettled refugees.

We will maintain clear, well-defined routes for refugees in need of protection, ensuring refugees have the freedom to succeed, ability to integrate and contribute fully to society when they arrive in the UK.

Refugees in the UK should have access to the tools they need to become fully independent, provide for themselves and their families and contribute to the economic and cultural life of the UK. We want to ensure there is effective support so that refugees can integrate and become self-sufficient once they make the UK their home.

We will therefore develop tailored and flexible employment support arrangements to refugees arriving to help accelerate their progress as they adjust to life in the UK.

We have already committed £14 million for a cross-government Refugee Transitions Outcomes Fund to offer greater support to refugees with a focus on employment and getting people into work. Building on this programme and other schemes available, we will develop a package of tailored support such as language training, skills development and work placements to help refugees build their lives in the UK. Because proficiency in the English language is so important for refugees to successfully integrate into local communities and enter the workplace, we will improve the offer of English language teaching.",-,Enhanced Integration Procurement Team,"Marsham Street

The PIN is intended to:

1. Raise awareness with the market of a potential future procurement process and to enable time for organisations to begin early discussions with the Department and each other as to how they may be able to deliver any future contract.

2. Inform the market that the Department will be undertaking market consultation activity during January and February 2022, to gather information about the supply market; to explore potential delivery models and associated benefits of those models; and to inform its understanding of the risks and issues relevant to managing transition to, and mobilisation of, any new service arrangements.

3. Inform the market that the services fall within the scope of Part 7 (Social and Other Specific Services) of Chapter 3 of the Public Procurement Regulations 2015, the so called ""light touch regime"" and that the Department will utilise the flexibilities afforded by Regulation 76(1) (Principles of awarding contracts), in determining the procurement procedure to be applied. The Department has not yet determined the detail of that form of procurement procedure but anticipates that it may include negotiation with tenderers. The procurement process will be set out in full in the procurement documents, in due course.

The Department has held a series of events during January and February 2022.

Event 1
The first of these events to be held virtually on Thursday 27 January 2022 and will be split into two parts, a morning session (10:30-12:00) and an afternoon session (13:00-15:00).

The morning session will be a plenary session at which representatives from the contracting authority will provide detailed information to potential suppliers about the proposed scope of the services and how we intend they will be procured.

The afternoon session will give potential suppliers an opportunity to discuss, in groups, these proposals with DfE representatives and other interested organisations in order to identify the strengths and weakness of these plans from a Market perspective.

Event 2
The second set of events will be held between Wednesday 2 February and Wednesday 9 February 2022.

These will consist of a series of commercial in confidence 1:1 virtual meetings between interested suppliers and the Department. They will give an opportunity to discuss in more depth aspects of the National Fast Track Child & Family Social Work Programme that may be unclear and highlight what aspects of the procurement are most attractive.

Links to book onto all of these events are available later in this notice. Spaces for all events will be allocated on a first-come first-served basis, but we intend to share the outcomes from these sessions with all potential suppliers following the conclusion of the consultation period.",https://education.app.jaggaer.com/esop/guest/go/opportunity/detail?opportunityId=53061,-,"Sanctuary Buildings Great Smith Street

The Council therefore has a requirement for nightly-purchased temporary accommodation that is partly furnished and is managed and maintained by the housing supplier. All organisations wishing to provide temporary accommodation service from June 1st 2019 onwards, will need to apply to join the DPS. This includes Providers that have an existing contract.
The initial ""Round"" for this DPS will be open for 30 calendar days. Following on from this, ""Round 2"" will then be open for 20 working days with ""Round 3"" onwards being open for 6 months. This means that Applications can be submitted throughout the duration of the DPS, but from ""Round 3"" onwards the Authority will only process the applications on a half yearly basis. This DPS Agreement is for an initial term of four years (until 31st May 2023), with an option to extend on an annual basis, depending on the Council's need for this type of temporary accommodation.

Outreach clinics for phlebotomy and therapies are also sited at the North Wing site in Bedford.

At the Luton & Dunstable University Hospital site, we are planning development of an Acute Services Block and New Ward Block which are essential to support Maternity, Neonatology, Critical Care and Theatre services. This is planned to complete by the end of 2024. At our Bedford Hospital site we are investing in Emergency Department upgrades and car park developments.

SITS will reduce delay by providing the capability for TfL to unlock significant additional capacity on the road network and also allow TfL to prioritise people who are walking, cycling and using buses.

The SITS programme will achieve these objectives by realising the following benefits:

- faster incident detection enabling rapid and efficient response and resolution;

- more effective utilisation of road network capacity to improve the efficiency of people movement;

- the ability to be modally targeted in TfL's management of the road network; and

- improved road network information provided to the public, policy makers and operators to improve decision making.

TfL believe there is a significant opportunity to improve our understanding of network users' movements in a cost-effective way through new technology, analytics and data.

Following proof of concept work, TfL has identified the possibility of utilising devices on the road network to capture flow data of different transport modes. Video Analytics will fill gaps in demand and flow information across all modes to provide classified counts to feed demand models in real time and is one of the data sources as part of the data roadmap project within the programme.

The potential contract resulting from this opportunity will seek to extend current coverage to provide continuous 24/7 multi modal demand data across the London road network, by purchasing a solution to collect data at street level for up to 1,300 monitoring locations. Further information can be found in the Market Sounding Questionnaire (MSQ).

TfL is seeking information from the potential market of suppliers able to provide a solution or solutions.

Interested suppliers will be able to view and respond to a Market Sounding Questionnaire (MSQ). TfL is issuing this PIN to invite responses from the market, with a view to gaining a better understanding of different commercial approaches to contracting for a solution for Video Analytics, as well as assessing the market appetite. The contract length and budget information in this notice is indicative only and will be informed by responses.

This PIN and MSQ form a standalone exercise intended to inform TfL as described above. As such, it does not form part of any procurement process. This MSQ should not be read as committing TfL to carrying out a procurement process. TfL reserves the right but is not obliged to carry out a procurement process in the future. If TfL were to decide to hold a procurement process for the purposes of this or any related opportunity then the market will be informed accordingly, including via a notice on Find a Tender (https://www.find-tender.service.gov.uk/Search).

The contract will cover construction, maintenance and resultant remedial small scope high impact works to the MoJ estate. In the main, this includes prison establishments but may also include courts, tribunals, Home Office controlled and corporate buildings.

The MWDPS will also be made available for use by Gov. Facility Services Limited, a MoJ wholly owned company responsible for the total facilities management of 48 prisons across the South of England, to source subcontractors to support its maintenance and project activities
.
Call-off contracts let under the MWDPS will have a maximum contract value of £1,000,000 GBP, however we expect the majority of projects to have a contract value of <£500,000 GBP.

The procurement will be undertaken in accordance with Regulation 34 of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015.

The MWDPS will operate across England, Wales and Scotland and is divided into five (5) headline Lots:-
- Building Structure and Groundworks,
- Mechanical Engineering incl. HVAC,
- Electrical Engineering incl. Security,
- Demolition Work
- Multidisciplinary Construction Work

Each of the Lots are further subdivided into Categories.

There is a desire to attract a broad range of Contractors to be part of the MWDPS. The number of Contractors appointed to the MWDPS is unlimited.

The MWDPS will initially be in operation for Four (4) years with an option to extend for a further two (2), two (2) year terms, at the sole discretion of the Authority, making a total of eight (8) years. However, the duration may be varied (reduced or extended) in line with emerging business needs
.
The estimated spend for the first 4 years of the MWDPS is £296,000,000 GBP (£74,000,000 GPB per annum made up of £64,000,000 GBP per annum for project work and £10,000,000 per annum for maintenance related activity).

The MWDPS, in itself, is not a works contract. Call Off Competitions will be held under the MWDPS for specific Projects or maintenance contracts. The proposed terms and conditions to be used for the Call Off Contracts are the NEC: Engineering & Construction Short Contract for Project Work and the NEC Term Services Contract for maintenance work, however consideration is also being given to a bespoke set of terms and conditions for straightforward or very low value works.

Individual call off project durations may be as short as 2 weeks but could be as long as 9 months. Maintenance contracts may be let for in excess of one year.",https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/Attachment/ab2e5a3d-a15a-497b-910f-0155d173dd48,-,"102 Petty France

Make Happen is the working name of the current Uni Connect Partnership, formerly known as the National Collaborative Outreach Programme partnership for Essex,
As it stands, the Uni Connect Programme brings together 29 partnerships of universities, colleges and other local partners to deliver outreach programmes to young people in years 9 to 13 and to adult learners who are aged 19 and above. Their work is focused on local areas where higher education participation is lower than might be expected given the GCSE results of the young people who live there. There may also be opportunities to deliver activity to students in year 7 and 8 through the Outreach Hub. However, the Office for Students may decide to further expand the targeted groups, within all the sub categories, during the life of the Quasi-DPS.

Make Happen is looking for educational providers/suppliers who can support us with meeting the government's aims.

Phase three of Uni Connect aims to:
* Contribute to reducing the gap in higher education participation between the most and least represented groups.
* Equip young and adult learners from underrepresented groups to make an informed choice about their options in relation to the full range of routes into and through higher education and to minimise the barriers they may face when choosing the option that will unlock their potential.
* Support a strategic local infrastructure of universities, colleges and other partners that can cut through competitive barriers, offer an efficient and low-burden route for schools and colleges to engage, and address outreach 'cold spots' for underrepresented groups.
* Contribute to a stronger evidence base around 'what works' in higher education outreach and strengthen evaluation practice across the sector.

We are looking to find suppliers to deliver schools and/or FEI activity which support the goals above. The activity could focus on whole year groups, focused group activity or one to one activity.

The Quasi-DPS has been extended for a further 12 months and is due to expiry on the 30/07/2022. The Quasi-DPS has the option to extend for a further 2 x 12months (in 12 months increments), subject to confirmation of funding by the Office for Students.

Organisations should ensure that they express their interest for all the relevant phases of the market engagement process so that their intent is correctly noted by the Environment Agency.

The Environment Agency intends to test this strategy and the outline design proposals through Phase 1, 2 and 3 of the Market Engagement whilst undertaking the Environmental Impact Assessment and preparing for the consenting process.

Those providers approved to join the system can then be invited by local commissioners to bid to provide APMS services when local needs arise.

The PDPS is a 4-year procurement exercise managed through a new e-procurement platform and will see:

GP providers appointed to an electronically managed list of approved providers



GP providers can apply and be added to this list at any time during the 4-year period, unlike a traditional procurement framework,



once approved onto the PDPS, GP providers can be invited via the e-platform to respond to requests for APMS services from local commissioners. These local 'call-offs' will be matched to the bespoke needs of local commissioners.


To ensure the PDPS can be managed efficiently while also being sensitive to local commissioner (and provider) needs it will be broken down in to Lots

Lot 1 - Substantive APMS Contracts

Lot 2 - GP Caretaker Contracts

The PDPS will be further broken down into geographical sub-Lots (7 sub-Lots in line with the 7 NHSEI regional areas). GP Providers can apply to be an approved APMS and/or caretaker provider in one or more of the stated Lots and Sub-Lots.

Application on to the approved provider list does not commit providers to providing APMS services, nor does it guarantee a provider will be awarded a contract through the PDPS, but it does mean providers will be able to bid when local needs arise. Applications to join the PDPS will be managed in consecutive ""Rounds"". These Rounds have specific start and end dates by which applications must be submitted. If a provider misses the deadline to submit an application for a particular Round, they can submit their application for evaluation as part of the next Round.

Please refer to the online document set available at the EU Supply e-tendering portal (link above) for further details.

There are real challenges in enabling social value to be applied effectively primarily because organisations have conflicting pressures on delivery, risk, scale and cost management which vary.

Orbit is passionate about building communities and investing in our communities. It is hoped that the growth of social suppliers is increased by working with Orbit and similar organisations across the housing and wider public and other sectors. There is an increasing desire to buy from VCSE's and this desire is being driven by organisational ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) approaches, a generational shift in expectations along with the direction of travel of government led initiatives such as PPN's 0620 and 1120, the industrial and civil society strategies and the Social Value Act.

The Help to Live at Home Open Framework has been developed by Hampshire County Council (The Council),in conjunction with The Council's partners (the 5 Hampshire Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCG's), current providers of Homecare services), to help meet the challenges of providing Adults' home-care services over the next 5-7 years. It is an opportunity for providers to work with The Council and CCG's to develop these services in Hampshire moving forward.

The Open framework has been set up to be used for personal care and support services by both the Council and the CCG's. The services under the Open Framework cover the Council's domiciliary care requirements(including the replacement of the Care at Home service), reablement services (currently contracted as REACT),the care element of extra care and the CCGs Continuing Healthcare requirements. This is not a comprehensive list and the Open Framework will be flexible to capture emerging requirements throughout it's lifetime.

The first stage for Providers interested in delivering work through this Open Framework is to register with In-Tend and then complete an enrolment questionnaire. The enrolment questionnaire will require providers to submit details relating to their organisation which will be assessed by the Council and successful providers will be admitted onto the Open Framework. The Open framework will always be open meaning that providers can apply at any time and providers who have previously been unsuccessful may re-apply once they have taken any corrective action.

Being accepted onto the Open Framework is no guarantee of work, but will allow providers to view and tender for Call-Off contracts for both The Council and the CCG's.

The Contracting Authorities intend to use the DPS to call for competition among Admitted Participants in order to award Call-Off Contracts for the provision of construction related consultancy services. The anticipated total value of these Call-Off Contracts is ?2 million to ?5 million over the term of the DPS.

The categories into which the DPS is split, each of which covers a role relating to the construction industry from RIBA stages 0-7, which are as follows:

Individual call offs from the DPS will support young people to develop independent living skills and assist toward step down and their own accommodation. The DPS will have providers with a range of accommodation and support packages who will bid for referrals put out by the Commissioning and Placements Team.

The service is required to ensure that the local authority fulfils its duty towards Looked after Children and Children who are homeless by providing sufficient local accommodation and prevent the use of Bed and Breakfast provisions for 16 - 18 year olds. There is a statutory duty to provide this provision.

If we do not have appropriate safe accommodation for our young people, we will not be meeting the duty as a corporate parent and risk vulnerable young people being at risk of exploitation.

This is a re-tender of an existing framework; however we now intend to procure services by way of a Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS), which will allow more flexibility and the potential for new Providers to join during the contract period.

Each individual contract will be subject to a Secondary Competition process and with new providers able to join the DPS at any point, this should enable us to secure a price for services that is competitive and reflective of the market at that time. In exceptional circumstances direct awards may be undertaken dependant on the needs of the young person.

There is the option for Nottingham City Council Nottinghamshire County Council and Derbyshire County Council to use the DPS for Secondary Competitions and Direct Awards.

The DPS is scheduled to run until 31st March 2024.

Applications are made in a series of rounds that open and close at the discretion of the Council. The latest round closed on 30th November 2020.

The DPS is currently paused to further applications to allow the Council sufficient time to review likely requirements over the coming months, specifically the numbers of potential placements required, the needs of our children and young people and ensure quality of the current provision to deliver as broad a range of accommodation and support as possible. We hope to have completed this by Spring of 2021 and may re-open a new round for applications at that point.

Further guidance for potential bidders may also be created and issued to ensure bidders are able to clearly assess their suitability for the contracts and understand the requirements and expectations of the Council, prior to commencing an application.",-,Paul Hallsworth,"Corporation Street

UPDATE MARCH 2020
Update due to an IT upgrade taking place (23/03/2020 - 27/03/2020) for the DPS. The new pqq_28831 has replaced the previous pqq reference. There has been the addition of five new Service Lines. Please see updated attachments containing details of the Service Lines and how to apply, in Other Information.

As set out in the Green Paper 'Improving Lives: Work, Health and Disability' , published in October 2016, the department is looking to deliver a number of new proof of concept' (PoC) to improve the support that it can offer and to understand what best works.

This is a Contract Notice for social and specific services in accordance with Directive 2014/24/EU Article 24. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) intends to establish a Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS) to procure these activities in in England, Scotland and Wales. The DPS is for the procurement of social and other services referred to in Regulation 74 of the Public Contracts Regulations (2015) and as such, the intention is to use a light touch regime, rather than the full regime described in Regulation 34 (Dynamic Purchasing System).

This DPS will present opportunities for organisation, with a focus on innovation and local specialist support, to be involved and test the development of new approaches for employment and health related activity. This will be key to building evidence to support the delivery of future provision at both national and local level.

At this stage we cannot confirm or guarantee any future business through the DPS but it is anticipated that there will be some limited numbers of proof of concepts in specific parts of the country in the next 6-12 months. However, it is expected that as the DPS develops the activity will increase involving most, if not all, parts of the country.

The T&L DPS will commence on the first date that DWP signs the first DPS Contract, expected to be in November 2018. The T&L DPS will be open ended, but can be terminated by the Authority with twenty (20) Working Days' notice. The expectation is that it will run for four years.
The expected total value of all Call-Off contracts for the DPS will be approximately £2 million for 2018-19. Thereafter funding for DPS procurement will be annually agreed (amounts to be confirmed), and may include monies from other funding streams.

This DPS will be for the use of the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), its Executive Agencies and those Non-Departmental Public Bodies (NDPBs) sponsored by DWP. Further information including a list of such Agencies and Public Bodies can be viewed by selecting 'Ministerial Departments' on the Departmental website.

Hampshire County Council is investing to build modern, purpose built , supported living housing for adults with a variety of needs, including those who lack capacity to sign their own tenancy .
Hampshire County Council is not a Housing Authority and is not able to operate the scheme and grant tenancies to the people that will be living there. We are looking for a third party to provide the landlord function to these Properties, to include:

• a lease on the building, maintenance , grant tenancies & provide housing management
• work with Hampshire County Council regarding nominations & management of voids,
• work with the commissioned care provider to resolve issues and support people to maintain tenancies
• support when a breach of tenancy has occurred

Care does not form part of the DPS and will be procured separately through the HCC Shared Living & Learning Disability Support Framework and /or any procurement model that replaces this.

Providers interested in delivering work through the DPS must register with In-Tend and complete a questionnaire. The questionnaire will require providers to submit details relating to their organisation. This is assessed by the Council and successful providers will be admitted onto the DPS.

The DPS is open meaning that providers can apply at any time and providers who have previously been unsuccessful may re-apply once they have taken any corrective action.

Being accepted onto the DPS is no guarantee of work, but will allow providers to view and tender for Call-Off contracts.

Existing business is anticipated to be retained by existing providers who have been successful in applying to the APL, on the basis of Service user choice. It is also anticipated that new business will arise each year.

The Open Framework For The Provision Of Public Health Services has been developed by Hampshire County Council to meet the demand of providing community based Public Health services over the next 5-7 years. It is an opportunity for providers to work with The Council to deliver these services in Hampshire moving forward.
The services under the Open Framework include Long Acting Reversible Contraception, Emergency Hormonal Contraception, NHS Health Checks, Seasonal Influenza Immunisation for eligible HCC staff. This is not a comprehensive list and the Open Framework will be flexible to capture emerging requirements throughout it's lifetime.

The Open Framework is conducted under the ""light touch regime"" Providers interested in delivering work through this Open Framework need to register with In-Tend and then complete an enrolment questionnaire. The enrolment questionnaire will require providers to submit details relating to their organisation which will be assessed by the Council and successful providers will be admitted onto the Open Framework. The Open Framework will always be open meaning that providers can apply at any time and providers who have previously been unsuccessful may re-apply once they have taken any corrective action.
Being accepted onto the Open Framework is no guarantee of work, and service users may engage the provider for the services via the Open Framework at any time. Providers will be engaged directly by the service users and will be chosen by service user choice.
Some of the services likely to be included in the Open Framework are detailed in the short description however the Open Framework will be flexible to accommodate emerging requirements. This is set out in the procurement documents.",-,Chris Powner,"The Castle

Materials
At present, subject to a few exceptions, the Council is responsible for identifying and arranging suitable outlets for the materials collected on its collection services, at its Bring Recycling Sites and through its Recycling Village. Some of these outlets are arranged on a joint basis with our partner Councils, Gateshead and Sunderland, and administered by the Joint Waste Partnership.

The requirement relating to each material is to provide a delivery point to receive the material, to then arrange its processing (perhaps through a series of stages and outlets) such that the maximum amount of recyclable content is passed into the supply chain, and the Council is able to demonstrate that recycling in its inputs to the national Wastedataflow database.
Services
Whilst the main waste treatment and disposal services are properly covered, there are a number of services that fall outside the scope of any Partnership arrangement, and which include:
• The receipt and processing of abandoned vehicles and caravans.
• The provision of a collection, delivery and emptying service for hooklift containers
• The provision of a skip hire (e.g., 6 / 8 m3 skips) service for allotment sites and other locations
• The collection and processing of scrap plastic wheeled bins
